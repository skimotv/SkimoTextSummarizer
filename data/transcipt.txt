very pleased to introduce to you our new

Managing Director Miss Kristalina

Georgieva and as you know she is history

because Kristalina is the first emerging

market candidate to lead the IMF and in

fact to lead any of the Bretton Woods

institutions and we are very proud and

pleased to have her with us tonight so

this is going to be a very informal

session you all know Kristalina very

well as someone who's been totally

committed to the developing countries to

reduction of poverty and to the voice of

civil society so I think her presence

here tonight speaks to that issue

I told Kristalina earlier that you had a

very good session many of you yesterday

with our executive directors and I know

you've had many interesting events and

fora here during these meetings and I

also know that tonight is a bit of a

highlight so the last thing I want to

say is please and please can you keep

your questions short because if you can

we'll take as many as we possibly can

but please this is not the time for

speeches long statements but punchy

comments punchy questions whatever you

want to say let's hear it but let it be

short so with that I want to ask crystal

ena to kick us off with a few remarks

and then we will get to your questions

and comments okay thank you actually can

I stand up and kind of walk around who

would that be okay please do thank you

very much for the opportunity to meet

with you some may know me from my base

at the World Bank and actually in

addition to being the first emerging

market national to lead the fund I

realized that I might stay in history

for quite some time as being the one

person

that was interim president of the World

Bank in other words led the World Bank

as he is now managing director of the

IMF building a bridge across the two

institutions for those who do not know

me I am a Bulgarian national grew up on

the other side of the Iron Curtain until

mr. Gorbachev came to power in the

Soviet Union and glasnost allowed people

like me I was in academia to apply

directly for scholarships in my case I

won a British Council scholarship and I

went to London School of Economics in

87-88

that was incredibly important because

just two years later the Iron Curtain

felt and my country had to take this

very tough transition road from central

plan planning to market and I was with a

bit of advantage I wrote the first micro

economics textbook to help Bulgarian

students learn what the market economy

is I caught the first macro economics

textbook and what was remarkable about

this because I had to write it for

people who had no clue what is price

mechanism demand supplied

I wrote it very very simply so up to

that very day people in Bulgaria like to

study from my very simple textbook then

I came I came to MIT the World Bank

recruited me as an environmental

economist dear was 1992 which we would

remember with let's see how many of you

for environment what was the most with

real so the World Bank made the

commitment in real to increase the

number of environmentalists by a hundred

and I was one of those lucky hundred

to be hired by the bank I had the most

amazing professional life at the bank

because I was able to to work on

technical issues but then to become a

manager than I was directed for

environment

I was country director for Russia based

in Moscow I came back I was vice

president corporate secretary and then

at 3 o'clock in the morning one night

the phone rang and it was the Bulgarian

Prime Minister who said Kristalina we

are in trouble and we need our biggest

gun

I felt very special Bulgaria's candidate

to be commissioner fell failed in the

hearing in European Parliament and I I

left the bank went to be a commissioner

and I want to tell you that being

Commissioner for humanitarian aid later

on I was vice president in charge of

budget and Human Resources but being

Commissioner for Humanity and eight is

the job the job that made me a better

person

because I would face the most tragic

horrible crisis caused by the evil of

man by conflicts or by force of nature

and I would see firsthand how resilient

people are and how when we talk about

international assistance and this and

that but who helps you in your greatest

moment of need it is your neighbor it is

your family it is the people next to you

so then I came back to the bank called

me but in my life a lot of calling

happens a bank called me I came back a

CEO and I had a tremendous almost three

years job at the bank I am very proud

that I helped the bank to be financially

strong and also the bank the World Bank

to be more attuned with the needs of the

most vulnerable people especially those

living in fragile states and the end

this time there was no phone call

actually I

I got encouragement from many from many

people from from emerging markets to run

for the European Commission I run sorry

for the for the IMF I run I got the

position and I can tell you this is

actually the honour of my life because

the IMF matters so much when it brings

to bear good policies that improve

people's lives my aspiration for my

colleagues and me is to always be

zeroing on how what we do makes

communities and economies stronger and

improves the life the livelihoods of of

people and I know that for many of you

this is not the immediate image of the

fund but under Christine Lagarde who has

done an exceptionally exceptional job of

leadership at the fund the fund has

embraced what technically is called

macro critical issues like inequalities

like corruption like climate like gender

and what I want is to continue in

Christine's tradition to make the fund

even more so an institution that very

deeply cares about policies sound

policies that are a foundation

foundation of better opportunities and

better lives everywhere this is my third

week on the job and I'm loving it

two things to share from this first

week's one the bad news the the world is

slowing down the world economy is

slowing down we had two years ago a

world that was synchronized in an

upswing 70% by GDP was growing faster

and faster today more of the world 90%

of the world is synchronized in a

slowdown in other words majority of

countries are still growing most of them

but but at a slower pace and when you

dig into why is this happening there are

many reasons some of them are made many

man-made reasons like trade disputes my

colleagues calculated that trade is

chopping 0.8 percent of global GDP

because of uncertainties so that I I can

tell you for what does it mean for us at

the front it means to concentrate on

supporting countries to weather a more

turbulent couple of years ahead we know

it is difficult for everybody in a

downturn but it is particularly harsh

for those that are already in difficulty

including some of the funds program

countries second big good news the fund

surprised me with subject matters that

coming from the other side of 90

straight street with my my box with my

stuff I didn't expect to find a debt

level of quality and in particular it

surprised me with work being done on

climate we just published the fund

published a new fiscal monitor

concentrating on carbon tax as the most

efficient way to drive low-carbon growth

the fund surprised me with the very

comprehensive work done and I'm sure

you contributed to that on social

spending in the attention that is being

paid to it and the front surprised me

with the embracement of the fight

against corruption which as we know

steals for people and most often from

poor people so I am I would be here for

the next four years eleven months and

two weeks and I intend to make the best

out of every single one those who know

me know how much I care about listening

to my own staff to people in the

countries to you I can promise you that

I would listen to you it doesn't mean

with always would agree there would be

moments when we will not agree but it

would be always on the basis of fair

open and mutually respectful engagement

and if there is anything that you know

about our work that you believe I need

to know I would be always always

welcoming your comments your criticism

you keeping my feet to the fire thank

you with this let's open it for

questions

okay everyone we have a microphone on

each side you can just start to head for

the microphones again please this is the

night for civil society so we want civil

society voices but please if you can

keep it as short as possible I'm going

to try and take as many questions as

possible

thank you let's start with the lady

thank you thank you it's good to see you

Jerry

my name is Joe Murray grease grabber I'm

with new rules for global finance and

Kristalina I would hope to encourage you

to track how well mission Chiefs

implement all the good work the research

department does on environment gender

climate all of the good things you

mentioned how well is it implemented and

then track the impact thank you

excellent comment thank you shall we

take a few take a couple maybe maybe for

fairness we go this way and this way sir

good evening my name is Noelle Carla

Ponzo I'm originally from the Congo

[Music]

advanced countries make available

information on taxis

so that researchers and Republic City

Society of course can access but

unfortunately many developing countries

do not make this information available

so what can you do to train your first

day thank you thank you I'm given

Foucault from Republic of Macedonia I

would like to ask you about the what

confront do in countries like Macedonia

with no arrangement to help us to fight

corruption which is widespread thank you

yeah thank you good evening my name is

armored I am from Jordan I have

direct question to you do you have plan

or plans to empower women while you are

making the history now to make history

in fighting corruptions in the countries

that we are receiving fund from you this

first part second part also can make

history

do you have plans to empower civil

society in the countries receiving

funding from from you also to fight

corruption and to make our countries

more transparent thank you thank you let

me take those and then we will continue

it is such a great beginning from your

site to have somebody who comes and

states very clearly where the shoe may

not quite fit and it is this

transmission from research and policies

to implementation in the programs and it

at the front is not an exception that is

an institutional issue everywhere I I

take your your call very seriously in

fact what I can tell you is that I have

been here only two weeks but I have met

now with quite a number of mission

Chiefs and my intention is to continue

to reach directly I I know the mission

chief for Egypt mission chief for

Ecuador the mission chief for Argentina

my intention is to be us engaged as

possible with those who actually are on

the front line implementing policies for

fairness to people sometimes we drop new

requirements with no support structure

of training and then measuring

implementation and

what you said that matters the most

measuring impact and we will be I don't

have a good answer to you today but I I

know that we would look into that very

seriously on the other side of the

street we actually did look into how we

can move from from inputs and spending

money in bank loans to impacts and even

even more more importantly outcomes not

an easy you know it's not an easy thing

but that is the culture we we want to

have I am I'm a big believer in access

to information I personally came to work

on environment because of member of my

immediate family got sick very seriously

sick due to groundwater pollution

completely avoidable if we had

information if we knew that the water

was polluted so whether it is physical

pollution or it is the social pollution

of corruption what is the best way to

deal with it

sunshine put it in the open I can't see

the person who asked the question where

do you sit the the access to information

question was from the car I'm so sorry I

was looking over there so so the the the

question of accessing information is one

to have that information available right

to start from from exposing it and then

to to make it accessible to people that

may not speak English or French for that

matter if it is disclosed in in French I

don't know today I cannot tell you today

what we do and what we can do better

maybe maybe Jerry maybe you can answer a

little bit more on this question but I

can tell you that if we have policy

changes that affect you and you have no

way to know we have a problem and that

is the problem we have to we have to

strive to

to address usually it is the

responsibility of the governments of the

authorities to disclose to their

citizens but we have a responsibility to

make sure this this is actually done and

again Jerry if you want to add anything

at a later point please do

how can we help countries with with

countries that there are no arrangements

we actually do engage with the

membership on a regular basis in April

2018 the fund adopted through the Board

of Directors a paper on anti-corruption

and it puts an obligation to the front

in its work everywhere with or without

problems and again I don't know enough

to tell you today how well we are doing

it in countries where there are no

programs and no arrangements but I take

your point that it's an important part

to follow up Jordan so what would I do

for empowerment of women I would do

three things one concentrate on where

legal obstacles are most severe and make

sure that these legal obstacles are

identified and eliminate it and make

this part of surveillance and a program

work of the fund systematically we do

some of it you know policy is there but

do it systematically the Middle East by

and large still is a bit behind globally

there are only six countries by the way

where women are legally equal to men

only six country in the whole world who

are Europeans here

so you can be proud all six are European

countries in the Middle East women have

less than 50% of the on average of the

legal rights of of men obviously this is

bad for women but it is even worse for

men because then women don't participate

in the labor force they don't contribute

and it is difficult to have a middle a

vibrant middle class if you don't have

women participating in the labor force

we also continue to look in things like

unpaid work very surprisingly the

accordion among countries on the

discrimination of women is unbelievable

so in Norway is the best country where

women do only 20% less unpaid work sorry

men - only 20% less unpaid work than

women only in Japan it is three hundred

and eighty percent women do three

hundred and eighty percent more unpaid

work in Pakistan it is a thousand

percent so how many you know how many

minutes how many seconds but never mind

so what we would do we will continue to

do relentlessly is to put out evidence

as to why gender equality matters where

we are falling behind that I promise you

we would do secondly we will work in our

programs to bring more empowerment to

women especially in the part that

concerns social spending educating girls

making sure that women have equal access

to health care all of this is in the

area of reviewing social spending three

I will make sure that ad

Funt we look like the world around us

today we don't quite yet with no

disrespect Jerry we have 24% women at

the highest ranks 25 at the next

presented the next level the lower you

go in the pyramid the higher the

percentage of women and this and

actually we also have underrepresented

nationalities it is not just about women

but if we want to do the number one in

number two I mentioned we have to start

from our selves and that we will do as a

folk tober well I'm not going to make

announcements because this is you know

but okay I started as a fucked over

first as a October first we absolutely

categorically would not consider

recruitment unless not only women are

shortlisted but at least one qualified

woman is presented for final interviews

and you will see change

so and of course for for civil society I

mean the font is a small organization it

is not not big but it has oversized

influence on governments and obviously

we we are the amplifier of your voice

when we can to make sure that you have

access to the high corridors of power

which site was next their groups key new

rules for global finance - I hope

since I consider risk-taking to be the

oxygen of any development I sure hope

you will act a little bit like a Troyan

horse coming in here and I am F because

excessive risk take a version has

created huge overhangs excessive

exposures against too little capital to

what's perceived safe and we all know

that all bank rises serious Bank Rises

results from two large exposures to

what's perceived safe

never ever from anything that was

perceived risky great point great point

thank you I'm sure from them in the

region

I heard you yesterday and I'm hearing

you today and you're aware addressing

things related to us a civil society

give me hope

but let me form it as a question can

some day the IMF have a min day towards

is more citizen engagement towards the

civil society thank you thank you yes so

first of all while I was at the event

women event yesterday as thank you for

addressing all of that my name is Senne

Preet and I work on AI for good and also

I'm an advisor on a billion dollar VC

fund so my question is are we doing

anything or do we plan to do anything on

the topic of AI for good and the second

question is that is it a platform for

women empowerment thank you

I'm sorry can you tell me a little bit

more about

yeah I saw artificial intelligence yeah

I feel good and there's so much

confusion going on and the topic of

artificial intelligence you know right

so two parts of the question thank you

okay thank you

hi I'm Julie I'm here for a Brazilian

youth empowerment organization and I

wanted to know if social

conditionalities among economic concern

elytis for landings wouldn't be a useful

tool for Singh issues such Argent as

youth and women thank you well my name

is Seema Chaturvedi thanks for this

opportunity I did not listen to the

session yesterday so my question is also

about gender I know in World Bank there

was this V Phi Initiative ultimately

it's said that when and there's a saying

in Hindi when you control wealth you

control some level of power and if you

control investing how can we look at you

to make investors out of women because

women investors ultimately will bring

difference in the balance and how can we

engage as private citizens in that thank

you let me take those and then we will

continue so I just take the point about

excessive risk-taking seriously the

announcement the reports we had produced

for these meetings actually maybe not

yet read but they certainly blink yellow

there is more appetite for riskier

assets why because interest rates are

low and there is search for yield sorry

that worries us we actually said 19

trillion dollars may be at risk because

of this more excessive risk-taking how

we deal with it beyond signaling and

giving policy recommendations this is

something that goes into the

fun surveyance work and it certainly

needs I mean in the spirit of humbly

learning from experience we certainly

need to pay to pay more attention not

only at the global surveillance but at

the country country level mandate for

citizens engagement I don't know what

exactly we had now at the fund we had

none

okay so I obviously this is a learning I

need to do and see I mean obviously at

the World Bank their policies and

whatnot on the other side of 90 Street I

need to I need to find out what we can

do here and whether the work that has

been done on anti-corruption for example

may be a good entry point in that regard

because if you want to reduce corruption

who are your eyes and ears citizens so I

will I will follow up on that I don't

know much about this AI for good so you

got me I don't know what is that

something that the front is doing or I

haven't heard about or it's in there so

I'm very sorry I I think we will have to

took up a side conversation and I'm sure

at the front among the super smart

people we have there would be somebody

who would tell me what the answer is

supposed to be and then if you give me a

cart or something I would have somebody

from my office to send you deep the

answer the question from Brazil is a

very very important question I actually

think that what has been achieved in

June this year with social spending with

the strategy on social spending is

absolutely transformative for the fund

and this is where we should be seeking

more more inspiration and then going

back to your point turning into

practical guidance - to our mission

chiefs and our program teams there is

already some good work

I got a brief with examples for example

one of the good examples is Jamaica

attention to to social spending to youth

specifically to youth and I and I

believe we we certainly can can and must

do more on on that how to get women to

be more economically empowered obviously

by removing the barriers that are

holding women back their legal barriers

they are conscious and unconscious

biases and who is our best help

technology because digital payments

access to digital accounts allows women

to get wealth and build wealth much more

easily than it is when you go to a tower

and the tower sees you're a woman at the

World Bank

we had a great story Bangladesh

switching pushing payments salaries and

benefits to be delivered digitally and a

woman tells me before you did that I

would get my my salary on a weekly basis

in cash my mother-in-law would wait in

front of the factory and take it from me

now it comes electronically can touch it

the woman was saving money and actually

becoming an entrepreneur so technology

is very very powerful public pressure

very powerful and I must admit role

models

very power powerful what is so amazing

is that the evidence is categorical that

companies that are led by women or have

women on their boards do better and the

most recent analysis says eight to

eleven percent better so what is not to

like but we have to have no illusion

it's not going to be easy to certain

degree women are they're worse we are

our worst enemies very often we

undersell ourselves and the value our

skills and capabilities so work to be

done and with this we turn to I forgot

which site first lady's person I just

wanted to follow up the first question

that we had you know this risky very

volatile and kind of money going to the

bones

it's a try so I followed up of one of

your research at the IMF and tried to

find out what was happening without

freaking bones and how it got stand

completely investment funds so my

question is and actually one of the

conclusions was also we have to deal

with the capital controls so my question

is whether you would be willing to kind

of review great the discussion also at a

national level because I think with with

Argentina you know that they have

secondly also to bring it into the

discussion on sustainable development

because if you have the flows going in

and out you do there's no way that you

can make sure that is sustainable so my

question thank you I'm a consultant

social innovator from Argentina member

of the Latin American organization

dedicated to strengthen democracy

fighting corruption and empowering young

political leaders I might ask you I'm

sorry

since I believe it will have a sentient

impact in our region and in our country

what is your personal vision of the

Argentine economy as a case

case sad news and its relation with the

IMF and also of the Latin American

region regarding economic growth and

democratic institutions thank you so

much for the opportunity

yep hello my name is Nabil I'm from

Oxfam so I have two questions for you

the first one is what is your personal

vision for how the IMF can dole out an

agenda to help countries reduce in

economic inequality and the other

question that I have is you being from

the other side of the Iron Curtain what

would you do in order to on the issue of

civic space especially when in countries

where IMF has programs and the countries

are using IMF programs to crack down on

unsafe space will you commit to speak up

when this happens thank you thank you

yes Kevin Jones chief economist of her

own financial also New York University

professor and I have two questions one

is about the negative interest rate so

in Europe or in Japan I mean we have had

low and lower interest rate and you know

in human history thousands of years

never happened what's your comment or

what would you do to deal with negative

interest rate I mean it's creating more

and more wealth gap I guess globally

first second question is I mean now

obviously when you know global trade war

in red area of Bridgewater talked about

where I really like 1930s like between

world wars and trade war is a watch with

IMF to to reduce the tension globally

whether you know us-china trade war us

you'll be Union and all those thank you

so let me take those and then now come

back to one more round it's a very very

important question about volatility and

rapid movements of capital that can put

the country bring a country to its knees

and what can be what can be done about

about that the IMF actually has worked

on that question and came up with an

institutional position on how to how to

address it and it is I think really well

balanced position it is not ideological

it doesn't say you never do it it

doesn't say you always do it and I think

the best week the AMF can do is to be

situation specific but also to raise its

voice as it is actually doing right now

all the risks to more vulnerable

countries policies that that have taken

by by advanced economies and the

spillover impacts of this of these

policies I don't I personally had no

ideological bent on this at all and I

would be very keenly interested to get

deep in it in understanding this

institution of view but then also

working with with staff of the fund to

assess it in the context of what is

happening today which takes me actually

to the last question if I may on

negative interest rates now we have to

recognize that negative interest rates

are not they had they have done service

to the world economy low interest rates

negative interest rates if we didn't

have that monetary easing it would have

been worse we would have been in we

would have had more people without jobs

more difficulties this being said

prolonged period of low and negative

interest rates

grounded in what in very low

productivity growth productivity is not

really helping in countries with

demographics that is what it is aging

populations this is something that you

asked us experts they said that may last

for a long time but there are some

negative consequences there are risks

that come from these low interest rates

the most the one that we are outlining

in our report for the meetings is more

risk-taking and that takes us to what

happens in Africa or or low income

countries in in Asia how come they get

into this bizarre Europe bonds that you

look at the structure you say why did

you do that well truth is we have

financial agents that are seeking higher

yield they go to countries and say

interest rates are low now is the moment

to borrow you miss out this moment you

miss what can the fund do and the front

is actually doing quite a lot of that

put in place stronger debt management

capacity in countries and be more

forthcoming in analyzing these flows and

speaking loud and clear of the danger

for economies that fall for that yield

in this yield trap there are also

distribution we impacts from low

interest rates what we committed from

the fund is to put more attention and

resources on looking into this question

of prolonged negative to low interest

rates and be more

variety in what advice we are offering

not only globally but more specifically

took countries that are especially those

those that are faced with more more

difficulties and just to finish with

with this last question on trade so at

the front we are in favor of trade peace

we think it works much better

there is now what I would call trade

truth and it is likely to help we are

saying 0.8 percent loss but if truth

holds it would be 0.6 percent loss

well loss nonetheless so we want we want

peace that's the short and the long keys

how do we call for peace we give like we

speak loud agree clear about the

negative impact on the world economy and

on national economies and basically we

tell people everybody loses in a trade

war some lose more than others

apparently behavioral economics says if

you lose more than me that makes me a

happy person I think this is nuts I mean

I also lose but that on this on a

serious note on a serious note we

actually think that right now in this

downturn the number one priority has to

be to strive for fair trade to restore

the ability of trade to inject route and

create jobs for people on the urgent our

Argentina on the economy of Argentina

obviously the country has had a number

of this boom and bust cycles in some

cases with the IMF working on trying to

get out that

they are those who those who know

Argentina very well much better than me

we would say there are some root causes

that actually lead to political

directions that that that impact

policies the font is not in politics but

we also don't live outside of the arm of

of how countries function and what we

are very very keenly committed to is to

strive to find a way in which we can be

helpful to to Argentina to the

Argentinian people and I think it would

be fair to say that by the nature of the

work of the fund we come when things are

really usually we come when things are

really very difficult they are no easy

solutions very very often most of the

time replacing bad policies with good

policies ultimately makes people better

of my own country midnight is we had

hyperinflation my mother lost 98% of her

life savings eaten by inflation for the

next five years she so much didn't trust

banks that any money she has she would

put it under the mattress mattress but

now Bulgaria is very good that we got

currency part that was like immunization

Bulgaria now has very sound monetary

standing and record high savings of the

population nearly 50% of GDP so good bad

policies

can be replaced by good policies and

people to be better off and we will we

will strive for that everywhere

including in in Argentina and I would

not get into the dead there was a part

of the question about growth in Latin

America and institutions in Latin

America we are kind of running tight on

time it's a long long conversation so

maybe what I can do is to invite you to

actually get with Alejandro Berner our

director for Latin America and have a

more in that discussion on on that so

let's go to the next round hi my name is

Nisha Mirza and I work for youth from

Brooklyn and Bangladesh from the United

Nation so first of all thank you for

being there for the women around the

world and my question is Bangladesh and

youth so as Bangladesh graduates from

the least developed status so how do you

measure the success of poverty

eradication and what's the role of youth

in civil society especially in

alleviating poverty and how IMF is

working with the young generation and

what more they can do thank you good

evening my name is Anna I'm from Global

Voices in Australia there are youth

known for profit organization so I'm

echoing some very similar comments there

as I guess more young people are

becoming disengaged and disenfranchised

with government and multilateral

institutions it would be very

interesting to hear your perspective of

how the IMF wants to engage with young

people involved making more effective

sort of programs and policies and I

guess more generally involvement at the

annual meetings as a young person we're

sort of far and few between so

encouraging more youth involvement to

ensure that they're not only young

people aren't just at the table but

they're actually a key part of the

decisions that are being made

yep thank you

I am Marcos Lopez senior economic

justice advisor for Christian Aid IMF as

my colleague has said before MF is back

in Latin America and what we are hearing

from the streets in Ecuador Argentina

Brazil and hate is that people is not

happy with this return so do you really

believe is it possible to have any

coherency between the structural

adjustments that the IMF is recommending

and the inclusion and inequalities

narratives that we are hearing from IMF

here thank you thank you thank you very

much I'm done on healthy commodities

including alcohol actually adding up to

the disease burdens in low and middle

income countries last year the World

Health Organization actually issued data

which indicates that every ten seconds a

person dies of alcohol-related causes

which includes cancer heart diseases

violence which question is what is the

funds policy in relation to lending to

the alcohol industry that is one and two

is the fund going to do to assist

countries to adopt price and tax

measures to raise resources to finance

and reduce alcohol thank you thank you

hi my name is Sean Sundaram

I have a question about disaster relief

or national disaster relief so two parts

the first is visa vie other

organizations the World Bank the UN

bilateral donors as a former

Commissioner yourself what is the right

role for the IMF in supporting countries

that are hit by disasters and the second

is how can the IMF ensure that its

actions don't lead to further cycles of

yep my name is primarily from Sri Lanka

a lot of things in the climate change

but the next few years

one of the series this was coming the

aging population I didn't see any in the

publication anything or do I go

something or what I'm going to if not hi

my name is research fellow with the

International Trade Union Confederation

my question is what would be your

commitment to ensure that the London

operation of the Bank issue espect for

collective bargaining and labor

standards and insurance living wages

that is my question thank you we have

been hearing that central banks running

behind digital transformation evolution

so I would like to understand what is

the plan of the IMF to help central

banks around the world to paste up

especially in developing countries paste

up a digital transformation yep

last question very last one again from

Oxfam my name is Nadia dar and I engaged

with you a lot when you were at the

World Bank and looking forward to

continuing that engagement with dyma I

had our Washington DC office and I just

wanted to remind you to please answer

the question on how you your vision for

rolling out an agenda on reducing

inequality and the countries you

operating in and if you'll be able to

speak up when there are crackdowns on

civic space in countries where things

are related to the IMF programs so young

people and what the IMF can do to

include your voice I'm just about to

lose my what what we are what we are

very interested in the research we do is

to see what is it that policies in

countries

help societies to be more inclusive more

inclusive not only for gender but young

people the elderly and then how can we

take this and make it digestible in

advice that comes through surveillance

article four and in programs and I can

say there has been there have been some

good examples usually what happens is a

research is done somebody in the fund

gets really excited about it takes it to

implementation and back to your point

and the really big struggle is to make

it not pilot in one one of case but to

get it through the whole work of the

fund what is done very much true

capacity development yet for the staff

of the fund but most importantly through

the capacity development that the fund

provides is to lift up these issues and

this and make this policy advice

integrated in in policies we also what I

want to see the fund being more youthful

itself in other words being more

aggressive to hire young people not

forever but they come they just up the

front they go to do something else and

that actually believe it or not when

institutions absorb in their own on what

they advise governments to do there is a

high probability it would get done now I

am a very bad example in this regard

because actually the governor's changed

the age limit so I can be hired here

but I actually I'll tell you for those

of us that are more closer to my to my

age well I didn't know that the fund

doesn't allow over 65 to run for

managing director once I knew I walked

up the wall then I knew I was going to

fight to get this job because this is

discrimination cannot exist on the I am

very I'm very very mindful that the in

many places the image of the IMF is we

go with drop on governments painful

adjustment programs and then we hold

them with money to do what is in these

programs that is actually very very much

no more if it has ever been exactly that

the case we want to provide financial

resources for programs that governments

themselves believe are the right

programs for the countries and we

certainly are very keen and often urge

and I can tell you I have been doing I'm

doing that we urge governments to pay

more attention to the most vulnerable to

people who are falling falling behind in

in societies but the front is not a huge

organization we don't have big teams

that that go and spend months and months

in countries so we have to trust our

partners in governments and I take your

point very strongly that we also have to

do more to bring the voice of citizens

of civil society the monitoring that

comes from civil society organizations

to help us do a better a better job we I

don't we don't lend to projects per se

so we don't fund

wine production or beer production the

fund provides support through the budget

of governments and usually with some

agreement what the money should go for

but we do have a way to influence tax

policies and especially tax policies

that would be improving health outcomes

taxing alcohol at the higher level I am

sure in the front programs they are

conditions like that to discourage what

is killing people and to encourage what

is good for people's health and taking

your question I would have I would

express interest with my colleagues to

learn a little bit more about what we do

with tax measures to to create the right

incentives for healthy living on

disaster relief the role of the phone

the font is tree fault one to provide

financial resources to countries when

they are devastated by a disaster two to

help countries with claw especially

climate assessments to assess climate

risks and three to help countries built

buffers budgetary buffers so they can

withstand shocks more easily and the

whole concept of shock absorb absorbency

in countries is something the fund does

I just came from a meeting with the

Pacific Island countries and this is

what we talked about how we can help

more in climate risk reduction

resilience building through the policy

policies we support on aging population

we I think we have done a study for the

for the Japanese presidency that was on

that that very topic I think I mean I

need to I lean on demographics

basically we are the fantasy interested

in them graphics in aging population as

well as youth but because they have

macroeconomic consequences and it is

indeed an area where you probably would

see the fund drink and more just because

you take a country like Japan or many

countries in Europe my own country

shrinking this is clearly a significant

macro macro relevant issue it is also

significant for gender equality because

aging populations even more need female

labor market participation on the

question of labor standards and

collective bargaining again because

these are not like World Bank does

lending operations where they can

include this condition conditions I am

not sure how the fund handles labor

standards environmental standards I know

that work is being done to identify what

is good practice but how exactly that

fits into programs I am actually not in

a position today to tell you Central

Bank's we are actually very much focused

on digitalization stable coins central

bank's issuing digital currencies under

what conditions and how that can be best

managed and I met with our team today

their focuses on especially emerging

markets developing countries and what

they can do not to fall behind in fact

this is an opportunity to leapfrog we

have seen it in some countries FinTech

in Kenya for example made inclusion

Financial Inclusion

reality true mmm better and I think the

the work in that regard actually like

links to the next question of what we do

on inequalities because the very best

way to tackle inequalities

is to provide equal opportunities to

people whether they are minorities

handicapped with no access to good

education what the fun tries to do is to

press on that equal opportunity

societies through the programs through

the policy advice we provide in equality

unfortunately in many countries has

grown over the last years and what my

predecessor Christine Lagarde has done

is to look squarey

into that problem in the face and

recognize that economies cannot succeed

if they are fragmented and if in

inequality grows what would I do what my

pledge on that would be twofold one you

would see me relentlessly pressing the

staff of the fund to answer a simple

question where is growth going to come

from and how we make sure that benefits

of growth are shared in a fair equal

equal manner and I very much believe

that people in the front are fantastic

you know day at the World Bank the boss

of the bank says something very

decentralized organization you say

something people say what what at the

front the advantage of being actually

highly centralized is that you say

something and the army lights up and

marches forward so hopefully we would

see that happening and the second thing

you would see me doing is relentlessly

pressing for more attention to fragile

states because this is where the most

vulnerable people live and where poverty

is on the rise

so with this we took a little bit longer

of your time thank you for your patience

thank you all very much

[Applause]
