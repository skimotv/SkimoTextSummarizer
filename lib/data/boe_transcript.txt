okay

okay

visitors

well everyone please rise for the pledge

and then remain standing for a moment of

silence

with liberty and justice for all

thank you

[Music]

good evening everyone as you can see the

board of education

is attempting to return to some form of

public meeting which is also compliant

within the limits set forth

by the governor's executive orders and

the guidelines of the cdc

and department of health we must limit

the number of people permitted

to be physically present as a part of

our compliance with those obligations

perhaps the most important item for our

meeting tonight is a public discussion

about the reopening plan for september

as it pertains to the plan we hope to

have answers to most of your questions

as part of the presentation but may also

need time for the administration

to research an issue on occasion you can

always email the superintendent with the

question as well

i am also aware that some attendees may

wish to speak about matters related

to conversations that occurred on social

media and the role of the board of

education in that regard

if you wish to speak please be sure to

fill out a card

and give it to the district clerk there

will be two opportunities for public

to speak at this meeting the first is

limited to comments relating to agenda

items only

we will then move through the agenda

after we complete the agenda items a

second opportunity for public comment

about non-agenda items will be provided

i ask that all present please be

reminded to be respectful of one another

the administration and the board also

the opportunity for public comment is

just that public comment

the board of education will not engage

in debate or back and forth

with the public during the period of

public comment in an

attempt to provide all who wish to speak

an opportunity to do so

our policy limits comments to three

minutes there may be people who wish to

speak

who have been left outside due to space

limitations

please ask security station at the doors

for a card and they will bring it in to

the clerk

again while we respect the community and

we always want to provide people with

the opportunity to be heard

if things devolve into personal insult

or invective as the president

i will entertain a motion to adjourn the

meeting i thank you all in advance

for your cooperation

to start tonight's meeting mrs heinz and

mr o'keefe are going to make a

presentation

about our reentry plan sure miss florio

could you

fire up the cameras for us

all right just give us a moment while we

wait for that and while we're doing that

i'd also like to apologize

to those from watching from home because

unfortunately obviously from that

distance

you're not really going to be able to

see our screen so

for that we're very sorry um you know

unfortunately the limitations

of how many people are in the room you

know have we been able to move it to an

auditorium we certainly would have done

that

um but we're limited to a total of 50

people

or 50 of a room's capacity whichever

number is lower

uh so unfortunately we're at that 50

capacity in this room this evening

this document we're going to show

tonight again is another evolving

document

back on the 31st we placed the

district's plan on the website as

required by state law

that plan had to talk about three

different models for return

which it did since the plan was posted

on the website

you may have seen additional commentary

from our governor where he has since

changed some of the parameters such as

offering additional

opportunities for choice for family uh

and or for staff

so we need to take those things into

consideration um so again

this document and the presentation

you're going to see this evening

is the most accurate as of now but it by

far is not completed

uh at the conclusion of tonight's

meeting in this presentation

you're going to get a copy of this

presentation emailed to you

through the school messenger system

it'll also be up on social media

and it'll be up on our website you're

also going to receive

an invitation to participate in a survey

regarding choice it's a follow-up to the

survey

that we sent out last week where we

asked potential preferences

this one's going to need to be more

definitive where we actually need to

know which families

are looking to have their children

receive instruction at home

versus those that are willing to send

children to school

uh so without further ado i'm going to

ask miss heinz to start us off

thank you mr o'keefe so this morning

we actually concluded and had our last

committee meeting which culminated in

the plan that we're going to be sharing

with you tonight

and as mr o'keefe said all of the

community members will be receiving at

eight o'clock

a phone call to this manner and um also

the plan

and the survey for remote learning um i

just want to thank

all of the folks that were on that

committee with us we are made up of

several community members unit leaders

staff of all sorts and it really has

been a pleasure to work with everybody

excuse me one second while i got this on

okay so after a tremendous amount of

feedback that we received from our

survey from our community

and given the lengthy documents that we

have given out and the models over the

past few months

i can happily say that we are able to

offer a full return for our elementary

students k-5

as well as a full return for our

students with disabilities our special

class

which would be our 15-1 classes our 12-1

classes and our 8-1

students and at the secondary level

due to size and the fact that because we

will need to reappropriate space at both

levels elementary and secondary

we will have to move forward with a

hybrid model for grades six to twelve

and that will be an a b schedule based

on alpha and household

the reason why we were able to uh offer

a full return

for our elementary school is because mr

o'keefe and myself

and our instructional directors and our

director for facilities and the building

principal

began walk-throughs last week we walked

through each and every room in our

buildings to space and measure at six

feet

on the average we are able to fit about

17 students in a class

now again please know that we have

scheduled a full return

with our total population so with any

remote instruction that would diminish

the amount of students coming into our

schools so we would actually

have even more room because of the re

appropriation of space we needed about

one extra section or one extra grade

level

k5 at each building generally so we are

going to be utilizing space in our

libraries in our arts and our music

rooms

and other common areas which we'll talk

about a little bit later on

remote learning is something that as you

know last week it was confirmed that

we will as districts need to be offering

this to our students as well

this will be a parent choice and a

consent uh tonight at eight o'clock

again when you receive that plan

there will be a survey in there and we

ask that only parents

who are looking to remotely instruct

their child fill out the survey

and it is due it is a fast turnaround by

friday

we need to be able to staff and schedule

the remaining students that we have

coming into our schools

remote learning again that is by a

parent's choice

with consent and no at this time

it is a decision for the entirety of the

2021 school year

i say this now because based on the

number of possible staff who may also

look for accommodations that might mean

staff members staying home in

conjunction with our students we need to

match up to see if we have enough staff

members who are going to be able to

offer remote instruction

or should we have to look towards live

streaming if we do not have enough

certificated staff that matches up with

the number of students

and so therefore we would not have

possibly a physical space for students

to come back to if that were the case

should of course all restrictions be

lifted through the governor's office

then we would have to and hopefully

would have a little bit of time in

between we would just have to

restructure and reschedule to ensure

that all students are able to return

remote instruction will entail it is not

like being in person school and it is

not distance learning distance learning

is

only going to be offered if again we are

ordered by

the governor's office to remain at home

all students and all staff remain at

home

and that would be live instruction for

two and a half hours on google me

that would be k12 remote learning is

different

this is um more asynchronous

learning with possible live or streaming

teaching

happening throughout the day this would

also be a schedule that would look a tad

different

based again on the number of students

and how we would need to support

everybody

but we just did want to be you know

fully upfront and present about that

we also know that devices for us we are

not a one-to-one school district we have

definitely made some strides and we are

in the middle of major infrastructure

work that is going on we just did order

about a thousand new chromebooks

in order to be able to disperse for

families that do not have any technology

in their home at all

but it would be difficult for us to

provide a device for every student in

their home

should they be on remote learning so

that would be something that the family

would also have to consider

students will be expected to complete

all assignments daily

and any students obviously with

disabilities on remote learning would be

provided all of their accommodations as

per iep

as for their iep

okay um it's important i'm sorry it's

important to just uh also talk about the

secondary hybrid model for six to twelve

on your a day let's just say um you know

for the sake of just explaining it to

everybody

uh it would be a combination on on a day

you would be in your child would run

their traditional regular schedule

they would leave with homework and any

work that would be on their google

classroom for the next day that they are

home

while the teacher is then teaching the

other second half of the class on b

obviously our teachers are committed

folks and they would be checking in

answering any questions

uh within that 24-hour period but we

would expect that at the secondary level

again

kids will be making sure that all of

their assignments are completed and they

are

and they are present attendance is

important as we move forward in this

school year

okay now that we shared with you a model

of how we're looking to return our

students i think it's very important

that all families and community members

now our staff knows

about the health and safety measures

that we are putting in place and we

continue to

look to put more in place as as time

goes on

masks will be required for all staff and

students both in school and on the bus

remember that the bus is an extension of

school any students are

having any difficulty wearing a mask for

medical reasons

or because of a disability will need to

submit documentation as always

they would affirm this with their

building principle or through the office

of student services

mass breaks will be provided because

remember in our classrooms our desks are

six feet apart

and in the regulations children do not

have to wear a mask during instruction

we would encourage of course that masks

be worn at all times but that does give

us the opportunity to give

multiple mass breaks whenever a child

does need it while they're being

instructed

masks are to be worn though however in

the hallways cafeterias if they're not

eating

recess any other common area that we

would just want to be

safe um we also every day

um oh i'm sorry excuse me uh bus travel

will also include as i said before

social distancing practices

optimally we will be looking for six

feet spacing and encouraging family

members to sit together

every day parents and staff will be

expected to fill out an online health

screening survey

and in this presentation when you do

receive it

you will see a hyperlink in there that

you can see a sample of what it looks

like

ahead of time we are also

we also took time to ensure that at

arrival and dismissal

varied entrances in all of our buildings

will be sanctioned off to separate grade

levels if they come off of the bus

we are also looking to uh take off the

grade levels

at increments of time off the bus so

everybody is not coming out at the same

time

so again just looking to work ways to

have plenty of flow

while classmans may not look typical

especially at the younger levels you may

not see

some of the rugs and some of the the

other items the kitchen items things

like that that you would normally see

please know that our classrooms will be

warm and inviting like they always are

because their teachers will be there

their principals will be there and we

will still be able to decorate it

we will just not be able to decorate it

with things that kids will be touching

because it would need to be sanitized

every day all classrooms will be devoid

as i said before

of any of those items that may collect

germs we are in the process right now of

setting up

opportunities for our teachers to

continue to clean out their their own

personal items

and we are also moving out any unwanted

furniture that we don't need in the room

so that we can maximize the space

hallways and other common spaces are

being marked appropriately

to ensure social distancing so markings

on the floor

items around on the walls and that's

also shared later on

in our presentation so you will be able

to see it at home as well when you open

up the link

hand sanitizer stations are located

throughout each building

all along the hallways we will also be

having them at the elementary level or

any other area for gym

cafeteria time when at the secondary

level they're able to go out

so as children go in and out they can

use a hand sanitizer

as they come into school all of those uh

you know welcoming areas would have a

hand

sanitizer station as well and at the

elementary level

we would expect that the students

because we do have sinks in every room

they would be washing their hands before

and after snack and before and after

lunch

okay so continued on as i said earlier

we have reappropriated spaces at the

elementary level

and we are in the process of doing the

same walkthroughs now in the secondary

buildings

we know it's going to be very difficult

especially for the cafeterias to be

utilized the way that they typically are

because children cannot sit in those

tables together so

moving in some desks uh looking at

classroom use all of those different

types of things

but really at the elementary level we

will be using again

if we're going on full return for all

students right now in elementary school

we would be looking to utilize our music

space our art space and so therefore

those special areas become pushing for

our students

we have worked with those departments

and we'll continue to work to make sure

that they

have everything that they need for their

lessons and equipment

cleaning of all buildings will occur

daily in the evenings

in each classroom we will also provide

hand sanitizer wipes gloves

and any sort of spray bottles and wipe

offs

for for our staff and or students who

feel encouraged to clean in between

applicable filters have also been

changed in our classroom events

uh we will also look to open up our

windows and our doors where we can

obviously you know the reverse was

safety making sure that your doors were

always locked your windows were always

closed

now we're being encouraged by the

department of health to please use fresh

air when possible so we will look to do

that prior to

it becoming too chilly up isolation

areas have been identified in our

buildings

and so if a child uh

is it has any sort of of symptoms or

they come to school and they have not

filled out the health screening

those students would be placed there so

that we can offer a temperature check

and make sure that everything looks okay

before we send them down to their

classroom

hygiene protocol visuals will exist in

all buildings if they're not there

already and again i share those with you

at the end

of our presentation so that you can see

them we will also be having routine

hygiene drills much in the same of how

we have regular school building drills

at this time unfortunately no visitors

will be permitted in our schools

we just cannot provide enough

secure measures for our staff and our

students and so

again we will be limiting all visitors

both traditional fire and hygiene drills

will be conducted

elementary snack and lunch will be in

the classroom to minimize flow

and secondary lunch it may be in the

cafeteria and alternately in the

classrooms

we will also rotate any outdoor areas so

for recess any of those other matters

classes will be rotated on the game

field the basketball court let's say for

example

and in our playgrounds students are

encouraged to bring their own water

bottles

we do have bottle filling stations in

all of our buildings

our water fountains unfortunately will

have to be closed at this time

okay so just some additional elementary

return details that we wanted to share

with you

you know it's always tough to start with

health and safety because again we don't

want it to sound like our students are

returning to jail but we do want to make

sure

that our students and our staff feel

safe for the return

but please know that on top of

everything that we are doing

the social emotional well-being of our

students is of the utmost

importance to us as well as of our staff

and we have

surveyed students

and we are looking to survey further the

rest of our staff to just find out what

are some of those underlying issues or

concerns that people have

so we can ensure that we have our mental

health staff there for supports

unfortunately we we will have to stress

that students may not share materials at

this time

students will be assigned their own

independent math workbooks

and guided reading baggies will be

provided weekly so that we have time to

interchange them out

clean them up and leave them for the

weekend so that uh there's a two to

three day lag before the

children pick up a new baggie and in

those items we will integrate as always

in our literacy and our math

our science and social studies topics

whenever possible

this will be in addition to the strong

direct instruction that our classroom

teachers provide already

all all students will be benchmarked for

their ela and their math to identify

their present learning levels

curriculum will be retard as needed we

definitely know that this will need to

occur for math

and we have provided some slides in the

past that show you that we're fortunate

we created our own math curriculum here

a couple of years back and we know uh

the

the one to two units that each grade

level will probably need to go back to

so that if i'm coming into second grade

i'm certainly not going to be able to

start on my second grade math curriculum

i'll need to be re-taught some of the

materials from when i was in first grade

and for literacy once the teacher knows

the collective

levels of what they have in their room

they will be able to

accommodate those literacy lessons

around that

art and music will be a push in again to

minimize the flow

and we are currently working with our

art music departments

this is one that was a really tough hit

music has to be 12 feet apart for any

coral

or any sort of wind instruments we are

working our hardest with that department

we are very fortunate here we have a

very strong music program and we do not

want to see that diminish

and so we are looking for ways to think

out of the box in order to be able to

offer course opportunities that might be

in smaller sections

and different ways to offer lessons as

well but we have provided and are

keeping all lesson areas in the

elementary schools

so that students can still maintain

lessons as needed

physical education will be a mix of

separating two classes typically that

are adjoined

so one class will be in the gym one

class will be outside and inclement

weather

they will rotate between the gym and in

the classroom um

mr butel and miss mcentee have reworked

their curriculum

to ensure that all team sports will be

done in the spring so all of those units

will be taught in the spring

and in the beginning it will be more

personal fitness

traditional grading will also return for

our students

while we know that there may be some

interruption in terms of what model

our students may have to face where we

hear rumors that we may have to go to

distance learning sometime later in the

fall

we fully believe that by using google

classroom no matter what we will be able

to make that seamless transition

to distance learning should we need and

we are well prepared as opposed to when

the crisis first happened and most

school districts were really just

grasping at straws

but we also know that the accountability

is something that is very important to

our students

very important to our community and

especially to our students who are at

the high school level

as i said before google classroom will

be utilized for communication at both

the building principle

and classroom teacher level we really

want to make sure that parents are on

one medium so that they can see any

communication

email messages lessons etc

and at this time we are going to enforce

to ensure for the safety of our staff

and other students

that any sort of instruction that is

done on google classroom or virtually

that our students adhere to our district

code of conduct

when students this year sign on families

sign on to look at schedules

they will be asked and prompted to sign

off on certain measures

around this

okay i just wanted to share with you

some of our pictures that

john and i took as we went around in our

walkthroughs these are some samples of

our our elementary classrooms

again they're not decorated yet of

course but you can see that we have

removed a lot of

the traditional you know wonderful items

that we would see in a classroom

but again we really wanted to maximize

space and ensure that the teacher had

space in the front of where their smart

boards are and then also making sure

that kids had room and were not

you know pushed up too too much so we

still are adjusting that

once every single classroom is created

at the building level

we will be returning mr o'keefe and i

with our team to just ensure that

everybody has space both the teacher in

the front of the room

and then students around so again we are

fortunate here

we do believe that we have enough staff

to move forward and should

the numbers for remote learning ensure

even more flexibility

we may be able to open up more sections

in our elementary schools and at our

secondary levels bringing back more

secondary students

uh this is at one more of the elementary

school and to the right there you will

see

a classroom um at the secondary level um

this particular sample is where we

marked

it the a and b desks so that students

will be sitting and then it will make it

a little bit easier for

cleaning at night for our custodial

staff

okay this is this is also a little bit

of a tough share here because i know

that we've been getting a lot of

questions

about child care and upk first child

care we

are still going to be providing am npm

child care

by boce by scope educational services

they continue to offer right now child

care throughout the pandemic for our

essential workers

and they are happy to move forward to

offer this

services for all of our students at this

point though we are

on hold for our upk program and that is

not because we don't have the space or

we don't want to but we simply have not

received the allocations yet from the

state and that is how we are able to run

our our upk program while we do have

many students who do a tuition based

into the program it is simply not enough

to substantiate the program should we

not get the allocations

so we are advising parents at this time

i know i've i've answered many phone

calls many emails

if you are need if you need care if you

would like your child to go to an

alternate preschool

now is the time to seek that out just to

be safe however

if we were to find out about the

allocations tomorrow we would also be

able to implement that

uh you know moving forward so we have

not changed anything we're not changing

any spaces at this time

um we're just kind of on a standstill

but to be safe

we just encourage you to look just in

case excuse me ms hines yes

yeah actually since we last spoke

earlier today

i spoke to mr duffy uh he's the

executive director of scope and runs our

upk program

just trying to see if he's heard

anything further about the program

uh and he has not heard much more than

we have as a matter of fact there was a

meeting earlier in the day with the

suffolk county superintendents

uh as well as mr wix who's the regional

superintendent for eastern suffolk boces

to see what boces knew about upk funding

and again their contacts in albany have

been very very quiet on it

the only information they've received is

you know

floating a balloon from albany that

they're considering

opening upk up but they may only fund it

at 80 percent

of what the grant would be so that would

mean if the district wanted to move

forward

that would be an expense that was not

budgeted for and we'd have to make a

determination

you know to take those monies from

elsewhere to support the program

so it sounds like they're getting closer

to a final decision

um but i'd have to keep the border prize

so it might be a model in which

we'd have to support 20 of the program

to make it move forward so i'll keep you

posted on that

thank you mr o'keefe um okay and then on

to now our boces cte program so those

are our students

because we do have two we have cte

programs that we house ourselves

they will still remain on the a b

schedule but the but the bose cte

programs where students get on the bus

and go to boces

boces did alert us last week that they

will be providing that in

uh house they do have the room so that

will be live every day

and for those students we will still

have busing from our high schools to and

from the program

we at this time though say that we may

need family support in terms of if your

child

might need a ride to school if they are

going to the program in the afternoon or

alternately

that is that is not solidified mr

o'keefe and mr savone

are looking at that through

transportation to see if we might be

able to accommodate and pick up

individual students at their homes

that would only be for those choosing

remote learning right only those

choosing remotely thank you

okay uh so here i just i share the

hyperlinks that you will see

on um on the presentation that that

we've sent home

uh for the sake of time i'm not going to

go through all of these links but the

top is a sample of our health screening

form

and the bottom of our all the protocol

visuals a sample of them that we have

smattered around every single building

and so for our next steps as we said

this morning we finished our planning

committee meeting where we

laid out the the final steps here with

our district leaders and

our volunteers our board of education

pres

presentation is is now as you can see

and then we also have a live community

forum on monday

at seven o'clock and we will be uh live

streaming it similarly here

however i would envision that we would

be a little closer that so that you can

see us

a little bit more clear um but on friday

we will be sending out a survey just

asking community members for

questions that they have we will collate

those into

subject areas and we will look to our

best answer any questions that you have

as well as our building administration

will be delivering a common q a

sort of like fact sheet about further

details pertaining to

to the buildings and this will include

sample schedules for all of our students

orientations how those will go out for

our grade six on our grade nine

some of that will be virtual and some of

that will still be activities just

broken up into smaller increments at the

building

as well as arrival and dismissal times

and bell schedules for secondary

students

and then lastly as governor cuomo had

ordered on friday

we are in the process of updating our

district website for protocols for any

symptomatic individuals

testing we are not responsible per se

for testing ourselves

but we are responsible for offering a

plan should a student or a staff member

go home

they are required to go get testing

where that could occur and then of

course they can't come back into school

until testing results have been provided

and then contact tracing as well

okay so that is the end of our

presentation this evening

we look forward to speaking and sharing

some more and clarifying more for you as

the rest of the night goes on

and then on monday as well at seven

o'clock

did i oh my apologies let me go back i

i didn't realize that i think i got

caught up in what we were saying about

upk before

um so my apologies these are some

additional details about our secondary

return

and again uh with the utmost priority

being the social and emotional

well-being of our students

in grades six to eight we will be

benchmarking for

eli we do that through a literacy

management system that we have

and also for math all of our math

departments

have benchmarking type assessments that

they do in the beginning of the year and

again this will be to identify

present learning levels in grades seven

to 12 curriculum adjustments

may be made for applicable areas where

prior learning needs to be had

so for example in our math and our

science classes

there may need to be some learning from

the prior year's

regents bearing class and so we would be

looking to look at

curriculum around that and possibly

offer review classes for our students as

well

again traditional grading will return

students may not share so we will be

limiting textbook use

and we'll be taking advantage of all of

the online subscriptions that we have

physical education again very much like

elementary school will be a mix of the

gym

outside fields and other large area use

instrumental lessons very similar to

elementary we are working with that

department to ensure that lessons will

occur they do need to be 12 feet if they

are wind and or choral in nature

and again we will be looking to figure

out ways in order to still offer those

choral groups

but in a modified version google

classroom will continue to be utilized

for

communication with both the principal

and the classroom teacher

again for a seamless transition should

we ever be ordered into distance

learning

lockers will mostly be used for am and

pickup only

that's not to say that if a student

really needed to go back we would not

allow them to but again just trying to

minimize the flow

and minimize how much our students are

putting into the lockers

so we would envision some form of

outerwear that's appropriate for that

time

and uh modified or or very um

you know slight binders and or folders

notebooks that they need

um stagger grades again in times of

at the end of the period we would be

announcing

uh grades so that they can come out into

the hallways so

that would mean that we would be um at

the end of the period

starting it a little bit earlier so that

we can allow each grade level to

disperse into the hallway to their next

period

okay sorry about that um

so that still is the end of our

presentation

um we hope that this did clarify some

further information for you we are

appreciative of the support

and the time that the community offered

us to be able to digest everything and

wait for the orders so we can bring this

to you tonight

thank you questions from the board

questions from the board is anybody jim

a john on the upk uh right now the way

that's funded is

uh correct me if i'm wrong like a six

hundred thousand dollar grant

primarily we get a six hundred thousand

dollar grant we hold a lottery

that allots 252 families a spot in the

program

we have more interest than that annually

but families beyond the 253

are able to participate for the same

rate which is about

twenty four hundred dollars per family

for the year

okay so if if the governor

uh would give us 80 percent

of that that would mean that the

district would have to come up with a

hundred and twenty thousand dollars

correct but are you in that hundred

twenty thousand dollars

are we counting that that the lottery

people

are not paying tuition that would still

be the lottery people

not paying right so in other words the

120 000 could be reduced

if the lottery people were willing to

pay a tuition fee

yes that was a model the board chose to

go with yes

okay thank you

just to figure back on what security was

saying

if they were to um to to uh

take twenty percent of that uh we'd be

looking at about 479 thousand two

hundred is what we'll be looking at

which is

what accommodate 201 kids you were

saying that you were concerned that we

we might not be able to raise the funds

to be able to

you know manage the program and have

enough you know what yeah i mean you'd

have to redo the lottery then i

i wouldn't i don't know if would

necessity would you want to use the same

number then cut it off well

i set off at just 201 and then and then

open it up at 237.69

per per family per month we could

examine any model that the board wanted

to take a look at

yeah certainly those other families had

already been notified that they were

among the families chosen

for the free program that's the worst

the worst case scenario would be correct

but let's say they take all the funding

and and they don't and

one of the concerns to have it i mean

have we thought about reaching out to

some of our state elected officials

flanagan

or uh doug smith to find out if they can

get us

clarification from the governor's office

as to whether or not he's going to fight

yeah we can certainly continue

to reach out quite honestly during much

of this crisis

much of them have been rather silent we

haven't been able to get a lot of

information

the governor isn't sharing much with

other people other than when he decides

to put it out

via press conference i mean normally our

local representatives are very helpful

in

getting information for us unfortunately

hadn't been able to get information for

us but it's certainly worth

trying i mean we're two weeks before the

start of school and you've got 252

families

not knowing whether or not they have a

pre-k yeah

i mean i don't know you know how the

board feels but i personally think that

you would get

252 families even if they took all 599

000

because at 237 a month for half day

pre-k

it's still a great great opportunity

sure and i can't and now more than ever

and and would be willing to work with us

if there was zero funding and we had

enough participation

to still run the program yes would can

we include something like that in the

survey

sits some of the families out there to

see what the interests would be we could

do a separate survey i wouldn't want to

you know not on the same survey

yeah put it out as a separate survey

specifically targeted to those families

that are already in the process

i have a follow-up to that where are we

putting all these students

if our classes are maxed out at this

time

we still have not reappropriated those

classes we do have a couple of buildings

because

of additional special education sections

that we needed that we moved the classes

but we have not taken away those class

spaces yet so if we

were to go with the will of the board to

you know put out a survey

and go with a tuition base we would be

you know all set to go

hi hi uh i just had a quick question um

about the bus

and what is the busing going to look

like

i mean again it'll also depend on

participation you know we put out a

survey to the parents

uh a week or so ago i think we had nine

thousand

respondents in in very brief order um

in that survey about a third of the

families uh

considered possibly keeping their

children home

um of the two-thirds willing to send

their children

in 65 of those

said they would use the bus the other 35

said they would drive their children to

school

um so just some quick math you're only

looking at say 4 500 kids

interested in using the bus based on

those numbers i mean they could change

when we put out the new survey um and

it could be that you know parents first

stop that they don't want to use the bus

and then during the year maybe they

start you know they need the bus

um so we're not reducing the number of

bus runs all the runs that have been

budgeted for

would be running um but with those

numbers you'd end up

literally with just about one child per

seat

you know so and then you also take into

account remote

yeah you'll get routed for 44 students

so in the worst case scenario

there could be two pupils in each seat

but based on

the information we're receiving i don't

think there'll be that participation

okay just um some clarification so

with the custodial staff cleaning each

night so they're going to have

more to do than they did prior have we

increased the custodial staff

since their job description will be

different to do

a more deeper cleaning every day daily

versus

yeah unfortunately that was one of the

items that was pulled back

on the budget so obviously we may need

to take a look at that again

we were rating 10 custodians uh and then

when there was issues

where we even today we still don't know

what our state funding is

um and we still have the potential of a

looming 20 percent cut

um we decided um if you remember

back to january and february we were

talking about this we were adding one

extra custodian each building

right um that was one of our

enhancements for this year's budget we

did draw that back

um so we're going to work with the staff

we have work with the

substitute staff we have and you know

man it as best as possible

to optimize cleaning okay and then

um with the uh secondary schools where

you have the a b

desks next to each other so that means

if i am an a student and i sit in

only the a and then the next day the b

desk comes in that image might change

though

i was going to say that that was really

more so that we can show a visual to the

families how we were spacing it out in

the beginning

those desks we would see needing to be

reappropriated and put into our

our lunchrooms different other areas

where we're going to need to

reappropriate other space the library

different items like that

um so i don't i don't necessarily think

we were just at north today

and in the classrooms that we walked

around in with miss trombetta there was

only about 15 to

16 desks in in each classroom okay yeah

that was an initial setup when we were

trying to figure out what it would look

like or how we could divide them up

but in fact with the style of cafeteria

tables we have

it it really prohibits the number of

children that can eat in the cafeteria

we believe we're going to take all the

cafeteria tables out of those secondary

cafeterias and store them

and put in desks i mean it's not going

to be the most attractive

lunchroom it'll be set up more like a

testing room where children will be

spaced six feet apart

right with classroom desks

correct but we do anticipate that we

would be able to offer breaks for

you know students to be able to go

outside and go into any of the

recreation areas items like that

elimination and so then um in the

secondary schools if the kids are

um changing classrooms um will the desk

get wiped down between

each change or how does that work in the

cafeteria

yes yes okay not in the classrooms that

would that would technically be not

possible i mean there's

3 000 desks in high school and 1600 or

so in

in a middle school that just wouldn't be

the means in that four or five minutes

of passing

to wipe down those tables but if we

student would want to do their own

destiny

the materials will be in the classroom

right we are providing that for every

classroom

okay and then one last question sorry

everybody it's okay

if a staff or a student happens to test

positive

that would then be reported and then the

cdc would guide us on what we had to do

like or we have our own plan how does

that work the department of health

the department of health department of

health so they would tell us

like so if it's one student in one

classroom right

that may be different than a student in

a middle school who

passes through a hall or mrs clayton's

become an expert on the matter

okay so the department of health and

and the new york state and the federal

requirements require us to make reports

for certain things

and they require the medical treatment

provider the doctor who's performed the

diagnosis for a positive result to

report information to

reporting for contact tracing so

therefore our obligation

we go above and beyond to make sure that

even if for some reason

the medical treatment provider has not

contacted the

contact tracing we will

just check you know belt and suspenders

that we have provided some insight in

case there's an instance

the other thing is when the lab results

come back the lab results

are um supposed to be also provided to

the contact tracing at which point

the department of health would be uh or

enter cdc would be contacting tracers

and determining

who they would contact including

students or staff

or family or whoever they came into

contact with

can i can i pick you back on that

question quick yes thank you very much

so on the checklist that we do daily

let's just say rob and i are in a

classroom and i find out that

he test positive for covid the next day

when my parents are filling out the

check sheet and it says

have you come in contact with anybody

that's tested positive will that prevent

my entrance into the building

if you're saying you tested positive

yeah if you're saying you're tested

right no i mean like

i'm not gonna tell you that rob

testifies we're not allowed to tell you

i mean i came to learn it it becomes

common knowledge of who it was

yeah and now i have to honestly fill out

the sheet yeah i mean i'm have to now

have to say yes i did come into contact

with some of the department of health

guidelines for close contact and this

is where it gets a little squirrelly

because you know

are we in close contact are we in close

contact

their criteria for close contact is less

than six feet for 15 minutes or more

um so we'll have to look at each of

those one at a time

and i can foresee the department of

health as soon as schools open

you know becoming overwhelmed with calls

from districts all around the state

um just trying to get feedback and

answers so we're building

criteria and protocols with our nursing

staff with our personnel staff

you know so we can make some of these

decisions on our own we have handled

situations already

even during summer school programs so

it's not that we're unfamiliar with how

to do it

we've had staff members with with covid

um so it's just going to be on a bigger

scale now that's all

and also just to mention mr block is

with us this evening from ingram and

smith he has been

our one of our main contacts that we've

been triaging information between

the state the federal what we have in

our schools what we can do

and what we can't do and trying to find

the best scenario for our students and

our staff and we'll continue to do so

and i promise this is my last question

so

if a parent chooses the remote learning

yes

they have to commit to that for the year

they can't change their mind like after

the first marking period

they're committing to that and then

their student um

cannot participate in let's say spring

sports

no so um i think in in the beginning of

the guidance it said that students may

not be able to

may not be able to um enter into

activities or sports

we know now that that is not the case

and that

if a child is remote they're still a

student of ours we're not really going

to have any activities so we don't

foresee that being an issue

so it's really more for sports but miss

trombetta who

sits on uh the community four section

has shared with us um information in

terms of

how they're looking at that language and

how we would not be prohibited most

likely from

keeping children back from sports in

september and then the child plays a

spring sport

and then come the spring sports are up

and running and you tell the child they

can't play

and please just know that when we write

that we're looking to make it more of a

commitment that could be up to a year

that is because we don't want to give

the misnomer that if a child says well i

want

you know a family to say that they want

to be remote in a week and then they

change their mind they want to do it

another week we will look at each case

but it would be very challenging for us

to bring back

large numbers of students who think who

feel they might have made a poor choice

because that would shift all of our

classrooms and all of our teaching staff

no i would totally agree with that i

just didn't know if it would be like

after every

marking period reevaluated but if the

parent does commit i just don't want to

hurt the student

of course by saying if um

extracurricular comes back in spring

your parent made this choice in

september and now you can't participate

right

and and i think for us you know being

just uh

of mine that things could shift very

easily we could look to

look at that come january and it may not

need to be a year-long commitment but we

did want to write it down so that

parents were aware

all right thank you very much thank you

for sharing this with us

yeah i have two questions or concerns um

when this plan was developed

to return to school k through five the

ada b day

it wasn't based on surveys that went out

as to

the number of parents that think they

would choose remote or not choose remote

it was based on our entire population

yes so conceivably

if we have a um a 6 through 12

model of a day b day hypothetically

every parent said i want my kids to

return to school

we can we can accommodate all of them in

an ajb day

you mean physically back into school no

we wouldn't be able to do that

how would we physically bring them all

back we don't have so

at the elementary level just very simple

math right we have to

take out about five to six seven kids

out of each classroom in order to be

able to accommodate that average size

my question a little bit on the six

through twelve model uh-huh okay

it that was based upon returning every

single child to school

so if friday the survey is

if we have if we have more children now

i understand you thank you

so if we have more children who are

going to be on remote we could

conceivably and i know we discussed this

this morning in our committee we could

look to bring back more

uh students my question is that my

concern is the same as laura is having a

one-year commitment i received

a half a dozen phone calls today um

probably in the last couple hours about

i'm concerned about the one-year

commitment we know

okay that you know in remote learning it

says

remote instruction is not equivalent to

in-person hybrid instruction

right so it's not the same level right

so for forcing kids out of school what

we're doing is we're creating a bigger

educational gap for the following year

well we're not forcing that would be a

parent's choice but the thing is we

allow them to come back after each

quarter

okay if we're able to accommodate them

according to the way the plan was

designed

why wouldn't we allow them come back

after after one quarter so they can get

that i didn't think we said that we

wouldn't be allowing we said that it

would be really prohibitive for us to be

able to reschedule them back into

classrooms

but we could look at it based on the

numbers that we have we wanted to be

honest

mr scavo and let families know that this

could be a year-long commitment

and most districts are looking at that

at either january or the year long

because it is very disruptive

that would mean having to up just move

around the entire schedule for

um you know our schools which we may

still have to do should covert

restrictions be lifted

but you wouldn't want to recant and we

know that that happened quite a bit

where in the beginning of all this

debacle we were putting out information

and then

something you know alternatively was

shared but i think we just said before

with

miss slattery that of course if we could

look at it by quarter and we felt like

it wasn't going to be a tremendous feat

for our families that we would do that

but i think that that's not probably

what a parent is going to make their

choice on

if i'm choosing to be remote it's

because i'm thinking that it's unsafe

for my child to be at school

so i'm hoping that by these presentation

slides that we have people will see that

we've made tremendous

tremendous um you know strides in making

sure that our schools are safe they're

clean and we're doing routine protocols

to ensure that

but the commitment is a year that's what

this time for right now yes

so if something changes at home uh a

person that's furloughed now has to go

back to work

right they want to and their their

impression is going to be that they

can't return because they signed the

paper saying

that they have a one-year commitment to

be at yeah but i mean i think though

um if if there's something along those

lines and we all get those calls all the

time if there's a family that really is

in enough need and feels like they made

the poor choice

or not a poor choice they made the wrong

choice for what their their thing is

going on right now so whether

a parent goes back furloughed or their

child is just not doing well in remote

learning and they were to contact us

just like any other parent phone call

that we would have of course we would

look at every case individually

but i'm talking as a whole we could not

say

you're going to be a remote and then if

you choose to decide in masses that you

want to come back we just would not be

able to run the same schedule and then

we would be restarting everything over

again

the reason why i bring this up is i

watched the the newsday webinar

yesterday

uh we had dr johnson i finally heard all

about him

i got a chance to see him in the

presentation along with a psychiatrist

along with a the superintendent of north

babylon and that exact question came up

right and a lot of the experts were

saying i would not go past

a semester in fact a lot of districts

are going quarterly

you know and i just don't i just don't

want to influence a person's decision

because they're fearful that

if they sign that paper they're not

going to be able to come back because

the reality of it is is that

you know when we look at the education

of even a day b day

my concern is that as a teacher you

can't teach the entire curriculum

and now we're talking about prior

learning being re-taught from the

previous year

how you and you're never going to be

able to teach the the entire curriculum

but the kids that at home that are not

getting the same equivalency of

education

are going to be further behind the

following year and which all we're going

to do is create a a snowball effect

and that's my concern i mean you know i

personally would like you know the

opportunity

that if they if they come back after if

they're the first quarter

which is a 10-week period or nine-week

period i think it would be a little more

settling for the people in the community

um knowing that all right this remote's

not learning i committed to a year

now i'm stuck well i mean i think i

think two things right because i agree

with you i don't think anybody wants to

be in the position where we can't

welcome back students interchangeably as

they need

and we definitely know that no matter

what happens curriculum is going to be

interrupted this year

that is a safe bet right but if we play

if it's the will of the board if it's

the will of the board to change that and

you would like to make that language

more flexible

we're happy to do that but please know

that we've taken you know quite a

concealed amount of time to making sure

we would prefer our students not to be

on remote but if a family really chooses

and needs to choose that we honor and we

respect that

absolutely um but yes i mean nobody

wants to do that but

nobody's the size of sagem either and so

we have different restrictions

that's why the question was the plan

design based on the entire

um it was it was based on of if all

students were going to be a full return

then we would have to go in an a b day

if we are finding though that we have

remote

students at a quantity where we can

bring back students

even an additional day or or by grade

level seniors first ninth graders first

you know however we look to plan through

that then that's would be our next step

so just like what we were saying earlier

in our remote instruction

um it's going to be hard to match up

what exactly the model will look like

until we have the survey results from

our teachers and for our families so we

can match it up

certification-wise my biggest concern is

we have kids taking ap exams

and getting those kids ready for that

and getting those kids ready for the

next level college

yeah you know we we have training as

much face time with with staff

it's absolutely i agree with you and i'm

very

i'm very thankful uh you know working

with the scta if we

ever have to think about distance

learning the fact that we'll be

providing two and a half hours every day

for our students so

running the same schedule just shortened

periods you know working on google

classroom interchangeably now and

consistently across all of our

classrooms

you know just right now currently we

have a tremendous amount of teachers

that are

undergoing pd virtually to ensure that

everything is is up and running and that

they feel

clarified and supported in that kind of

work but

you're preaching to the choir i couldn't

agree with you more that this is a

really challenging time i have a high

schooler myself

and she's in a smaller district doing an

a b schedule

um so i scratch my head a lot right now

so i i completely

respect and understand and if the board

would like us to look at

the year-long date please just let us

know and we'd be happy to accommodate no

this this will go

the uh remote learning actually just

went out that survey just went out but

we can

i mean i could send it on on on remind

in five minutes if we wanted to say you

know that we've changed the date

um but it sounds like maybe that needs

to be more of a discussion if we're

looking to go that route

meredith engine and then jimmy

so on the remote learning if a parent

were to

choose that model um i understand that

we would want them to commit for the

full year because we are

devoting staff just to that remote

learning right we're not using

a teacher who may be inside the

classroom sometimes

we're going to utilize the staff that

for whatever reason has to be

staying at home to be our remote

teachers

that's the optimal plan right so at the

elementary level

um it works a little bit easier in that

in that

fashion if i'm an elementary teacher and

i'm out i can conceivably

teach any of those grade levels if i'm a

librarian obviously that certification

et cetera et cetera it gets a little

trickier at the secondary level

because if i'm a chemistry teacher and

and i'm out and

maybe i don't have as many students out

for chemistry

you know then what am i giving to that

teacher in terms of work that they would

be doing for that day so one could say

that she would

switch what they're doing and now

they're going to teach more science

electives and they can support any of

those

students who are out needing science

electives so it's really going to boil

down to

looking at the hard numbers of students

matched up with the

teachers that we have should we not be

able to match everybody up

which i'm hopeful we will be able to

then we would need to start entering

into some sort of live streaming or

larger groups of google classrooms where

a teacher instead of having a class of

maybe 25 or 26

in a google classroom we may have to

have larger numbers

and so then that's why the year-long

decision or not doing it every quarter

becomes very challenging for us

if i'm a teacher and i'm running a

google classroom of 45 kids

and now some that those classrooms want

to go back what classroom are they going

into where am i fitting them into

so then you're having to change people's

schedule

it's a lot of moving parts it is and

then

if um so we have so children

are able to through their parents choose

whether they want to come back to school

or not our teachers are not electing

whether they're coming back to school

the

the teachers that are staying home to do

the remote learning are the teachers

that have

um reasons why they cannot return

and so even if tomorrow

you know three weeks after school

started all of our remote learners said

well

this is for the birds i don't like this

i want to go back to school

we wouldn't then have the ability to

bring them back because even though we

did the classrooms for them

we wouldn't at that point have the

ability would we well not at this time

because again with

six feet we are you know down to the

amount of numbers that we have but if if

our numbers look as such where

um the remote learning is um a larger

quantity than

our elementary classrooms let's say for

example instead of them being 17 that

might only be 13

or 14 so then we could start welcoming

them back but that would be based on

almost you know looking at each student

individually and being able to see how

we can

schedule them back into school which is

probably a very

physical impossibility in the next three

weeks it's a little hard

yeah um

with our secondary schools

um as a as a secondary mom it is

it it kind of does stink and there's no

two ways about it our children no child

is going to get the best education this

year it's just not going to happen and

something we're going to

try our best yeah we'll definitely try

our best right

um if one

let's say somerset had an influx of you

know

80 percent of their kids wanted to stay

home and remote learn

that would open up a lot more room but

it wouldn't necessarily mean that we

would

do somerset where their children win

every single day

and the rest of them no we would be

making decisions that are consistent for

all students but then we might be

reappropriating staff to help out

in um other ways in other areas and i

don't want to put you on the spot but

it's okay

that's why we're here we're on the spot

have we looked into sixth grade at all

because in my opinion sixth grade is

that lost

grade it's a grade where they're a

little too young to still stay home by

themselves

and not only just stay home for the day

by themselves but also

teach themselves kind of you know get on

this get on the schedule get on the

computer do what you got to do keep

yourself moving on that

b day have we visited something that

once we get all our numbers because i

know we can't really finalize anything

until we get all these surveys and

numbers

but once we get all those numbers are we

going to be able to maybe look at sixth

grade

going every day as a possibility yeah

that's absolutely you know that's

definitely a conversation that we've

been having as

as soon as we know what the numbers are

will we be able to welcome back

additional grades and i would i would

assume that we would be having these

conversations with with all of you our

administrative team obviously as well

um and sixth grade is one of those that

was a really

hard thing to kind of cut off at

um because we know that they could be 10

11 years old going into school and i

would not feel comfortable

myself at times leaving my child home

for long periods

um and so yes we've had those

conversations and once we know the

numbers

we'll be able to come back and report if

we're able to make any changes good

thank you so much no problem

just a quick question some clarification

yes um piggybacking a little bit on what

mr scavo said are we

entering the year making an assumption

that we're not going to be able to

deliver 100

of content in regards to secondary

curriculum

if that is the assumption that i think

you said that we're almost entering into

um i mean who's going to choose what

topics and what's being covered are we

letting

different teachers different people it

just it concerns me that we're

entering i know there's no perfect

answer and there's no scenario that can

right that under these uh circumstances

that you've given you but

um i guess that makes more of mr scala's

point is that

if we're making the assumption that

we're not going to be able to deliver

content we should be trying to uh

wait till so many surveys come back and

see how many kids we can actually get

yeah and um so no right i don't have a

perfect answer for it but i can tell you

what we're doing to set up for that

um i had a chair meeting a couple of

weeks ago so our instructional leaders

in each department to talk about that

especially at the secondary level

and so we would be looking at our

curriculum at what are the big ideas at

the end of the school year what is it

that the students are expected to learn

so they can um you know move forward and

pass

those classes and or regence exams we're

also hoping to have a little bit more

guidance in terms of the state education

department

in terms of what they're going to do in

relaxing standards and curriculum

and testing so much in like how they had

canceled the regents we don't hope for

that we hope more for choice

so that these students who are working

hard getting grades attending

will be able to at least have a choice

for regents if they want to take it and

see what kind of grade they get

um i don't i don't think we're looking i

don't think and i know you mean it this

way but we're not assuming we're not

going to be able to get through our

curriculum but we want to be real with

our families

the curriculum could look a little bit

different than what it normally does

and i know our teachers again hard

workers are already looking at that

we've had some conversation for example

around science lab hours usually that's

seat time

now the state education department has

relaxed that and that could be

also a virtual so we've already started

those conversations

once we come back into schools in our

department means that we've been having

anyway virtually

we'll continue those talks and start

looking at that together

so this at the secondary level state the

new york state creates the standards for

apn regions right

so haven't given us clarification

okay well ap is through uh is through

the college board

and so we actually are starting as you

know uh a new ap capstone program at the

high school so those teachers that

um are gonna begin teaching it for us

this year they just went through the

training for that

and right now ap is holding tight to

what they're doing but we also know that

at the last minute they made some

changes around what they did testing

wise virtually

um so we are advocating and i think mr

o'keefe spoke about this earlier

while we have not heard a tremendous

amount from our legislators at this time

we have been advocating through our

local boces our associations

talking to talking to the college board

and just hoping for some teamwork for

relief

so that families know that you know

we're not looking to make any decisions

that are going to make impacts for the

students but we also have to be real and

they have to work with us

so we're hopeful for that no problem

aaron the so by the weekend we will have

uh the figures on how many people are

opting for remote learning is that

yes all right and the way we have it now

is uh they're being committed they can

make a commitment

for one full year uh just just for my

identification

let's suppose it came back to say 30

percent of our district

one which could be right which could be

what it could be sure what does that

change anything uh for us with the ab

days or or or as meredith said the sixth

grade

situation would let's say 30 remote for

the year would that

change uh you know

what we're doing right now yes

absolutely so like what i just said with

business

also gonna take you know where is the

thirty percent yeah it could be

heavily weighted on the younger children

right you know is a k12 pet families

deciding

they want to keep them home right you

know it really depends on the breakdown

of the of the groupings and the grades

of where that 30 percent is

or is it leaning more on one side of the

district versus the other

uh it's not as clean as just if it was

thirty percent

but yes spaced across the district that

would make it easier we can see

some movement i'm just not sure that i

could say for sure right now that it

would be at the secondary level we would

just need to see where it is

and just aggregate that and just look at

it and it also boils down to to

you know certification areas too as well

how much staff we have in um in each

area i fully understand mr scala's

position on that i really do understand

but i'm trying to

trying to look at this as if you put out

a survey

tonight which is already gone but if you

put it out

and it said your one mocking period and

you could change your mind

then kind of i would say that you really

we're stuck with what we've got this is

this is the way it's got to be because

you don't know

from market period of marketing period

how many students you're going to have

is that accurate well yeah i mean but

but that goes to back to what we said

we can't put out there that you can make

the decision after each quarter if we're

not sure we're going to be able to offer

that

and so i know it may have looked like it

was a little bit stricter than it sounds

like the board was was willing to move

forward with and so again we're

certainly open to

putting in alternate language and we

could send it as as quick as you know as

soon as we're done here or

first thing in the morning i certainly

don't want to prohibit anybody from not

doing remote learning

but um again it's it's we have to be

practical in the size of our school

district so we can't say

we're going to be able to offer things

that smaller school districts can right

away

but it is prohibitive based on on the

numbers so yes

we might be able to offer that and we

might be able to offer more grades into

our secondary schools we might be able

to offer

more space for our elementary students

we just won't know until we see all of

those numbers

getting to getting that number that

we're seeking

this weekend will drive uh

where we go next yes and that's why it's

challenging to be able to share

with our staff and with our community

what remote learning will

you know essentially look like as well

if i don't have enough staff i can't

guarantee that you're going to be in a

google classroom with a live teacher

i might not be able to offer that it may

be based on whatever elective or store

or grade that you're in it could be some

sort of like a live streaming but

but again it really it depends on on the

numbers of the students that we have

uh up against our staff as well thank

you jim just just real fast to pick it

back i apologize i walked out for a

second

if only 75 of the families respond to

the survey

so now there's 25 of the kids we don't

know what they're doing no the default

is that they're coming to school

okay yeah thank you no problem

so i know with elementary the teachers

usually take their lunch when the

students

have their lunch how are we working that

if they're having a lunch in the

classroom who will be supervising them

so uh we do have obviously aid support

we are also working with our principals

because we know that we're probably

going to need some additional

help with that um but we also um

know that uh you know that

lunch is managed um i actually thought

that there was

some staff that was a part of the lunch

periods

that might be mistaken yeah i'd have to

look at that um but we are we are having

conversation to ensure that we have

um the support we need for lunch

two more actually what will clubs look

like virtually

so that's that's another new and

exciting uh question

right we definitely know that clubs are

not going to be able to be

maintained after school physically we

have

started to work with an online platform

called passport for good

and it allows clubs to run virtually and

note on all their activities attendance

community service hours if a child is

working any of those types of hours

so we have to enter into conversation

with our teachers about what that could

look like

we certainly don't want to not offer

clubs but you know

once a week twice a week what sort of

activities how will you meet with them

will google me be a part of it those are

the questions that we're looking to have

moving forward around clubs and one more

with the staggered start times

those are students still changing for

gym class

we will not be changing for gym and we

will not need to

because we have moved team sports to the

end and we're looking to do more

um you know personal fitness that isn't

rigorous

but no we would not we would not be

looking to have any

any uh you know contact in that manner

for our students

[Music]

as i sat here tonight i thought about

saying absolutely nothing

and i really don't know where to begin i

don't have a specific question

i can tell you that i'm incredibly angry

internally right now

uh and it's not at anybody in this room

but i thought that uh i haven't

organized my thoughts completely they're

just bouncing around in my head

but i want to say a few things first i

want to say that

you did an outstanding job in the most

difficult of circumstances you've put

together a plan

every school district is in the same

exact boat that we are in

questions asked tonight by rob alex

laura meredith

uh everybody here great questions

uh and we don't have the answers to any

of those questions and we are going to

be surprised i think

greatly by the things that we find

i think that you know people could look

at what's going on here tonight and they

may think that

all of us agree on this model and think

that this is what we have to do

i'm sure there are people watching this

tonight streaming or we'll watch it

later on and they'll think that if

you're sitting here i'm sitting here and

i'm quiet

that i must agree with this plan and i

think it's wonderful

and i'm going to tell you that i don't

it's rotten it's a rotten plan

that's going to do tremendous damage to

our children

i've been teaching for over 22 years now

i can remember when i started there was

goals 2000.

maybe some people in the room remember

that maybe you don't

then there was no child left behind

and then most recently there was common

core

there's never a time in which it seems

like a bad idea

can't come about a bunch of garbage

and nonsense that does anything but

improves the education

of our children as i sat here tonight

and i watch that slideshow

and i watch those desks sitting so far

apart

i thought what kind of dystopian period

of time

have we entered into where we look at

this and we accept this as the

quote-unquote what i hate

to say the new normal it's not normal to

me

it's not acceptable to me i want you to

know

that if it were up to me solely i would

defy the governor

i would send all of our children back to

back to school

i would give them that opportunity i

believe that

his edicts are completely unrealistic in

terms of delivering a sound education to

our children

and i believe they are not well-based in

terms of research and data

and so on so when we look at how many

children have ended up with covid and

what's happened to them

there's no question that covet exists in

my mind

i lost one friend to it i almost lost a

second

several who had it very badly who

thought they might lose their lives

so there's no question that covet exists

however

when i look at the numbers and when i

look at children getting covered

what i see is that our response

is disproportionate to what is going on

and we are willing to just fall in line

and listen to the leadership of this

state

this country and do these things and i

know there are people who feel like me

and i know there are people who don't

feel like me a third of the survey

respondents who have said

i'm not comfortable sending my child to

school and i am all about

parental choice if you do not feel

comfortable sending your child to school

then i encourage you not to i encourage

you to homeschool i encourage you to use

the remote option

if you're not comfortable with that

however i feel like i've been denied my

choice which is to send my child to

school i'm willing to tolerate that risk

based upon what i know

because i think that the damage being

done to my child

that still is in in school and the

damage being done to other children is

tremendous

i taught remotely for the last what

three four months of school

and when i tell you that i did as good

of a job as anyone could do

with live instruction every single

day all right i worked very hard to do

what i did

and i watched kids slide into the great

abyss

and some of those children that i

watched slide are supposed to go off the

princeton this fall

are supposed to go to cornell are

supposed to go to

uh you know you name the school and

and they're going columbia and so on uh

but yet i've watched each one of them

slip and i've watched a few

hold on and i've watched the most needy

students that i taught

completely slip we're not getting that

back we are not and here we are

and here's where we're going so i'll

leave

on this particular note sometimes it's

real easy to just go along

and i feel terrible for people like you

folks the administration here

it's simple and i'm in the same boat as

an educator

it's my job it's how i support my family

and live my life

and as a result of that i'm forced to

comply because if i don't i'm out of a

job

but the solutions we've come up with

they're not good solutions

they're terrible solutions and they are

solutions that are going to harm each

and every one

of our children and at some point i do

believe that people who feel the way

that i feel are going to have to think

long and hard about how we stand up and

demand

what we want for our children that we

think is best

i just want to say before i ask my last

two questions that was well said bill

i i feel exactly the same we do so well

said

um i just want to talk about um the

boces because we're also feeling some

questions today about boces

um as i mentioned earlier in the meeting

community meeting where there was only

50 people in that meeting

um where there was only 50 people there

was 50

how many people 50 volunteers and then

all of our staff

as well yeah go ahead um you know having

worked for boces for

going into my 29th year you know over

the decades

things change school districts go to

block schedule kings park did at one

point

um school districts for financial

purposes decided that

you know we don't want to send two bus

routes to boces we only want to have one

route

and as a result okay they basically said

to our agency

look whirly standing in the am this year

or will he sending seniors in the am and

juniors in the pm

and they've changed things so that it

accommodated him and our bosses always

accommodated him

and my concern with some of the

questions with some of the students that

are in cte classes

that are that are scheduled to go to

carpentry and auto body and and

you know whatever other programs they

signed up for

is that transportation becomes an issue

if we have an a day b

day um those particular subject areas

you have to be there every day

you can't teach somebody how to sand the

fender and paint it

remotely it's just not something that

can happen so i suggested

earlier that maybe we should call boces

uh eastern south post and say look

we pay anywhere from 14 to 20 000

tuition depending on

the particular student if they have an

iep or not or if they need additional

services

um we can only stand in the am because

of the situation we're in

you know and get their feedback you know

i don't believe we

i don't think they want to lose the

tuition yeah no i agree and and uh

and you know i did appreciate that idea

because i'm not

i i know you're in western but um it was

just

you know shared with us the model that

they were running and so we

traditionally we're share we're told

what our schedule is but we are quite

large and i agree with you

we pay an exorbitant amount of money

into both season it's certainly worth

the conversation

the second thing we have in-house cte

classes where we have cosmetology

um yes and and you know using the same

concept i mean

if we have to get uh our kids there

every single day the suggestion that

you know we've we've done in you know

boces

is that we try to allocate you know uh

the junior students first year students

the am session this way they could take

that bus up every single day right

and just have to get a ride home two two

days out of the week

and then the pm students or the second

year students would actually attend

cosmetology and pm

because many of them may have driver's

license and license

um it's just another suggestion to be

able to accommodate that population of

kids

that really need to be there five days a

week especially cosmetology students

that have licensing

and all that stuff which by the way our

cosmetology teacher i mean she

she really just went above and beyond to

ensure that the kids had the experience

they needed even if it was virtually so

i agree with you and i do appreciate uh

that feedback

and then just the last thing is more of

a more of a comment and it's frustrating

because i

i hear what bill saying i hear and if

you don't mind

i really do uh mr coggins i uh i don't

want you to think or anybody to think

that we just you know laid low because

of our jobs

um i think everybody knows i came from a

district where we stood very

tall against things that were coming

down from the state education

department i think when you're talking

about health it's a little bit

challenging

but i hope you understand and i hope

everyone in the community knows

that at no point did i think that i was

doing this just because it was my job

but because i really do want what's best

for children like i know all of us

here but i stand just as equally

frustrated when you're out and you see

people out and about

in playgrounds and beaches and and

whatnot and we're held to you know very

different standards

but when i tell you that we're working

18 19 20 hours to make sure we're given

the best

i know it's not what we all want but i

do respect what you said and i really do

appreciate

uh that feedback my last thing is really

more of a statement

and um you know when i look at the

guidelines for opening in new york and

it seems like they print a new one every

week because they change

the rules so crazy um you know you look

at them if i can say that

you know john when you said it was

cryptic it really is i mean

you need to you know you can interpret

this 50 differently yes yes but they

have a mandatory column and then

recommendations for best practices which

i don't understand

but it talks about um ensure that social

distancing six feet

uh at least six feet or a physical

barrier is maintained between

individuals

while in school facilities on school

grounds including cafeterias

unless safety or care of activities such

as moving equipment or elevating

elevators traveling in common areas

requires shorter distance of individuals

but then number two says if social

distancing is not possible

individuals must wear acceptable face

governments yep that's exactly

how we interpret what we talked about

earlier if we have to move kids back

into a classroom

the way i interpret this and maybe legal

legal counsel give me

you know their opinion right is that if

we had to move desks closer together

okay to be able to not be able to you

know uh

accommodate the social distancing by

putting masks on the kids we would be

able to do that

and that's exactly how we started out

our planning if you remember we had

looked at i think it was the

massachusetts model where

we were looking to at least go no less

than three feet and when we did that it

was like everyone's high fiving each

other everyone's coming back this is

great

and i don't mean to put mr block on the

spot but we did receive

guidance from legal and it looked as

though that masks were not going to be

appropriate alone

but we read the regulations the same as

you it was just as disappointing when we

found out that was not to be

mr o'keefe the other day um you'd

mention that if we were able to go three

feet we could accommodate every

student every kid come back every

student we had every

building make up a class for three feet

and so we were able to

say that if parents felt safe for their

children to return

that we were able to do that our hands

are very tied

um in terms of that and you know again i

don't mean to put you on the spot mr

black but you may want to

jump in then it was a few weeks ago

where you know we thought that

just mask face covering was going to be

sufficient if you couldn't maintain the

social distancing

uh but then the governor's office came

out and clarified that and said that no

you have to have that physical barrier

and um so that then took away our what

we thought was our ability to have face

masks but the face coverings are okay in

the hallways and the bus

yes well yeah there's no it's not that's

yes nothing makes sense

but that is uh that's that's what we're

following

so aaron um as we all know i should have

had a swivel

chair john i'm just saying should i have

a swivel chair as we all know

um education is is

not going to be pretty this year um and

we want to

give our children as much as we can and

we've spent so many years

working on this educating the whole

child and worrying about social

emotional

i'm the most emotional person shouldn't

be talking about this but um

so a couple of things our most

vulnerable social and emotional as we

see

little children adapt much better you

see a two-year-old in target with a mask

on it's not a problem

um my teenagers find the mask

uncomfortable and and

so um hours six through 12

in my opinion are our most mentally

vulnerable

and i just feel like um

because things are so different are they

going to be able to

just go down to the guidance counselor

just go down to

you know or things like that like like

where they want to

just go take five minutes with the

guidance counselor or even the school

psychologist

is that still going to be fully in place

opened to everyone is there also i know

that um

i know that over the the distance

learning period

last year that our sagem north um

sel chairs they they did a tremendous

job having

a google meet also are are things

for mental health in place and then my

other question is

what does recess look like in um in

covid land in elementary

um i think yeah because i think i

lightly brushed over that so i'm glad

that you asked me about that because

you know so last year was the big thing

that we were taking away five minutes

from lunch

and recess and uh see there's always

bigger fish to fry people

um so with that

they're gonna be allowed to go outside

they're gonna be allowed to run it all

off

are they allowed to play on the play

gyms are they allowed to

play ball with one another or is it

you're going to stay there and just run

in place and you're going to stay there

and run in place and

yeah i mean i think realistically they

are children we're going to do our best

to set up

so that it's a safe environment but

there's not going to be boredoms out

there if they are playing ball

i can't tell you that we will they're

going to be as i said earlier rotating

between

the fields that we have the playground

equipment that we have and then the

basketball courts so we would obviously

have equipment outside for that

we do have sanitizing stations that we

will be utilizing for the students

but again um you know as i said i think

in the beginning

we do not want our students to come back

feeling like we're in jail

and the first thing that we had on our

slides was the social emotional

well-being of our students and i'm very

proud of the program that we have built

here

and we are just looking for unique ways

whether it be virtual more push in from

our sel chairs

you know all project kindness all of

those things we'll still have them this

year they just may look a little bit

different

in terms of the mental health staff ms

graham and the office of student

services

now under the direction of mram better

with ms graham

we will be deploying guidance counselor

all of those different

all of those services are still in place

but we see ourselves doing more

proactive lessons as students come in

and more push in into our classrooms

so that students feel comfortable we

know the issues that we're seeing

out there again our sel chairs have sent

out a survey to our students at the

secondary level

and i agree with you at the elementary

level we're going to be doing more

proactive resiliency skill

type of activities with them our health

teachers

for the past year have been building a

health workbook for the elementary

schools that are rooted in all the

resiliency skills that we have been

studying using the university of uh

pennsylvania so we're really excited

about what we can deploy for our

students

and you know it goes back to yes we are

so worried about curriculum and we are

we are

we are going to work to ensure that all

big ideas

as much as we possibly can until this is

all over is taught

but our first charge is just making sure

that those kids feel happy and safe and

healthy coming in

and our staff as well our staff has not

only been teaching from home

uh prior to the summer but they also had

their own issues that they may have been

you know undergoing so that is our

number one goal here

thank you no problem mr keith mr science

uh one of the

important questions that was asked this

morning was about safety and about how

kids are wearing their masks on the bus

they're getting off the bus and now

they're walking into the building with

their masks on

maybe a hood on maybe a hat on and

they're not going to be as easily

identifiable

as they have in the past one of the

suggestions was to wear

lanyards with maybe id cards i'm just

wondering what else if there's any other

suggestions if there's

how are we gonna i mean obviously health

and safety is

number one concern that that is a that

is a major concern of

not being able to recognize kids and

especially ninth graders who are now new

to the building

so we don't know any of them to begin

with and and sixth graders are now going

in there

right so there's going to be a lot of

unfamiliar faces and

even more unfamiliar with me well so not

too unfamiliar only because we do have

our transition meetings for all fifth

graders

going into the sixth grade and then all

eighth graders going into the ninth

grade

and we did those virtually over the past

few months prior to the ending of school

so all teams at the high school level in

conjunction with their middle school and

then middle school to elementary school

we met on every single student

not just some but all so they were able

to physically see a picture of the

student talk about the student all of

those things so

so we're hoping right that there are

similar uh some familiar faces coming in

but like we had talked about this

morning the use of the student badges we

have never

truly enforced the way that we need to

now but we would have to ensure that the

students

are maintaining that and showing that

because they will be wearing masks as

they

come in however we are also spacing

things out so the kids aren't coming

into school in mass quantities

so should in fact you know prior to all

the badges coming out you need to slip

down just so we can kind of recognize

you put back up and go back in

i think we would feel safe and

comfortable in terms of that but we'll

be

working with our staff working with

security and seeing what other measures

that we can

um you know put into place john i don't

know if you wanted to add anything to

that just to pick it back up

if we're going to have the kids wear

their id cards just a matter of how fast

can we get the idea yeah that's the

that's the only thing and that's why i

say in the beginning we may just have to

do the old-fashioned

put it down for a second so i can see

but you know our staff is pretty astute

and

granted the ninth graders uh we may not

recognize them all but

we all you know we know our students

here so um

that's obviously another concern would

be now we have them wearing their id

cards

and of course we all know that 10 to 15

of the kids are either going to lose

them or forget them

do we have a mechanism to reprint them

in the building daily

so that everybody has one um

thank you okay so just for the community

we we are able to duplicate that yes

thank you thank you miss any other

questions

we moved on i just wanted to make sure

that we at least took a poll of where we

stand as

on remote learning did we want to take a

poll and leave it at

one full year of a commitment did we

want to talk about a half year did we

want to talk about a quarter

i think it's important that we do it now

so that we don't wait until last second

and

we're changing yes

[Music]

i understand what rob was saying before

about this i'm just curious why it

wouldn't be sufficient

if we just changed the language to where

we could evaluate if it were possible

and had people understand that it could

potentially be that long

but we could of course if situations

allow we can

we can we can shorten it and truncate

the time period can i just ask a

question to mr block i mean i just just

because i can foresee

i'm sorry jim just because i can foresee

something are we

are we even legally allowed to tell

somebody they're not allowed to come

back

that's you know that's a that's an

unanswered question you know and it's

unprecedented um

from a legal standpoint and you know i

understand fully the operational

issues from a legal standpoint you're

going to want to see more flexibility

because the concern is that

family will say that being denied my

right education

it responds back is no you're being

educated being educated remotely

but that's not the same type of

education as an in-person education

so from a legal standpoint i would

recommend

that there be some flexibility built in

i was actually going to

state that if you were going to do that

um still keep the year

uh but have a reevaluation the ability

to be able to re-evaluate

as ms heinz said that that's going to

occur on a student-by-student basis

anyway if there's a concern from a

parent

but parents are maybe being a little bit

um

not almost like misled but don't not

aware of the fact that there may be a

re-evaluation

but that's something you may want to

clarify and you could do it in an

interval period you could do it

you know after the first quarter yeah

that's as a re-evaluation for example

yeah i mean yeah one of my concerns

would be is that they realize what

remote learning entails and they're like

i this is not what i signed up for we're

not going live we're not doing this or

not right and then we get an influx of

kids and now class sizes grow and we

don't have

the space to have everybody in so i just

i want to make sure that we have that

flexibility i'm sorry jim

[Music]

well my position is i like what bill

just said my position was to get the

true figures the way it went out was

probably

the right way to go so people aren't

saying well i can experiment for a while

and we never really get a true picture

but at the same time i think if you put

it if the language was softened up to

say

the possibility of a full year is real

uh however you know there's going to be

uh independent cases that have changed

etc etc so we all know that we all know

that this could all change

but to get the true figure up front

i think they have to be aware that this

could be a full year

of remote learning uh yes that's just my

opinion

yeah and i apologize i don't have the

survey in front of me i don't i think i

said

could be but i don't recall but we could

certainly again

put that out once we see the numbers and

if in fact we feel like maybe families

felt a little bit um it was too strong

and they're not really quite sure we can

we could send a call out we could send

out

an email as quick as you know now if we

wanted to the reason why i asked that

question is

is that we based that plan on every

single student returning yes we did so

the issue is not space

the issue is scheduling yes that's

correct right yes so i view it as

well and and because of the six feet

right you know obviously space because

of that but the six feet parameters is

what allowed us to go to this plane

to accommodate every kid they should be

right so if we don't have all

if if not all kids return then we will

have more space obviously and then

can bring back more kids so so the thing

is like i said

the issue is not the space matter you

know the plan was

devised based upon every single student

returning

and that's why i suggested you know

maybe doing it once you know one

or four times a year um you know for

that reason i understand that it could

be a

nightmare scheduling well if the

restrictions aren't lifted i guess

we have 13 kids in a seventh grade

honest math class and we're looking at a

schedule

you're going to look at the section say

all right put them in mrs smith's class

or put them in

yes correct yes so you know the issue is

that you have this

you have the space it's just more of a

scheduling thing and i would imagine

that

if more and more kids come back from

remote learning we could reassign

teachers to

classrooms yes well and and that's the

point right so in a year where we're

already saying the curriculum's

interrupted the day has been

corrupted that's the only thing that we

wanted to minimize in the beginning and

get a true account because

you don't want to be moving teachers

around and upheaving schedules but we

can of course

always hand select and uh you know put

students in as outliers who really do

need to come back but we didn't want to

forget i don't know who said it before

we just didn't want people thinking i'm

going to try it out for a week and if i

don't like it i'll go because we're just

that would be really good

a quarter um you know and that will give

us enough time to do the planning

and do the scheduling if we have if we

had to i just think that the one year

signing something this is one year

scaring heck out of people based upon

the phone calls that i received today

so i guess we'll have to then decide are

we doing flexibility

the flexible option obviously is the

best for everybody but do we want to say

one year or do we want to say by quarter

and i guess we'll vote on that so

if you want to do a full year write it

with flexibility

you can vote on that full year

flexibility yes

so just put we'll put our hands up and

i'll just we'll count them all

full year with flexibility or

flexibility with

re-evaluating every quarter

okay so yes

but maybe we could put what would be the

best way to

well yeah i think that what i suggested

would be if you want to stay with the

full year

but that you re-evaluate on a quarterly

basis yeah because i just caution us to

if we all of a sudden say flexibility

then people you know i just

we have to have a true account school

starts in two and a half weeks and i i

don't mean to be

crafts about that but we we really do

and so i think mr black the way that you

had said it

um i think you know it's a year but we

would be

reevaluating it throughout the year for

everybody i i i like what he said

does that mean

no i don't think that you're going to

make that full commitment i don't think

you can quite frankly

yeah so i think that the concern was

being raised was that parents

under the impression that you know no

matter what i do it's a year now if i

commit it's a full year

that's not going to be the case we're

going to look at it on a quarterly basis

again it's change there could be a week

wake up tomorrow with an executive order

which states that parents you know can

make the choice on daily basis

you know so um you know so i

uh i think that what it's going to be is

that the district will look at it we're

going to look at our operational needs

we're going to look at

the parental needs and make you know an

informed decision

but that the benchmark be on a quarterly

basis

would it help if we provided some sample

language and then you're able to

let us know if that language looks

appropriate

because we can send that out you know as

quick as uh you know sunday evening or

monday morning for folks

perfect thank you any other questions

all right we are back in the agenda

letter f approval of minutes

can i have a motion motion by mr mike

caruso second and by

meredith opie all in favor opposed

abstentions motion is carried number two

we are in the visitors section public

comment that pertains

to the agenda i'm just going to need

those cards

or if you're going to call them is fine

too yeah sure i'm going to call up the

names we do have several i just wanted

to

make a reminder announcement that the

visitor section the public comment is in

fact a public comment it's not a

question and answer type of period so i

know that

some of the cards that we are getting do

have questions on them

i think possibly it's better you know to

if if questions are asked we can have

them written down and we can take your

email and we can have a response sent to

you by email if that's good

or mr picarella if you want we can also

include them in our forum

on monday that's fine right yeah i just

think it would possibly be best to email

or

you know speak with you separately

regarding okay

um so the first gentleman mr caputo

i'm sorry capuano

oh

okay my name is mike capuano my daughter

is brooke capuano she goes to sagem

you have an excellent school here and

you have an excellent school because you

have

the best teachers in the country i

believe when you take the teachers away

you have a bunch of buildings here okay

uh to think that you're going to lock a

child in a room with a bunch of

books and if you could fast forward 10

years that like a doctor or a lawyer is

going to walk out of that room it's just

not going to happen

okay now the main reason that we're all

here

is the six foot six foot six foot six

foot that's all

we're here for why don't we tell

everybody that that's a farce

if you build the partitions around the

desk the six foot is not necessary and i

called osha and i called the governor's

hotline

okay if you build the glass petition the

teachers are worried also i understand

that

if you build a glass petition against

the front

the teachers could walk in the back and

they would be behind the petition

711 protects their cashiers and they all

come in when it's time for their shift

and they're back there

furthermore the children could walk in

behind their petitions and take their

masks off

the teachers could be up there with the

blackboards and take their masks off

and everything would be back to normal

this is all we're all here because we're

refusing to build the petitions

you could take that desk there's schools

that have taken that desk

and they divide it like this boom and

boom and there's four children on that

desk

and it's totally legal you can be when

you put a mask on then

or any kind of petition they said you

could be nose to nose

i was just in a restaurant that was so

packed the booth

the person right behind me i turned

around i was looking right in his face

i called the hotline from there because

and they said as long as there's a

petition

there was a petition in between the

booths and the petition was only this

tall i was looking in the guy's eyes

and they said there's no regulations for

the height of the petition

okay so all we need is the petition and

all this is gone

okay second of all second solution why

don't you just have the people that want

to come into school

and the teachers that want to come into

school come in and the ones that want to

stay home and the children that want to

stay home stay home

instead of forcing the ones that are

horrified to come in to come in and the

ones that are desperate to come back in

my daughter wants her teachers and she

wants her school and she wants her

friends

okay what if

all the cops and firemen and what if the

truck drivers that supply the

supermarket didn't come in

everybody who needed to came in

to to help and they kept america going

to mind odds that the schools are the

only ones that let us down

now as this gentleman said

these kids in five years if we could

fast forward to the ones that are

starting now they won't be able to read

and write

i don't know how many people go to

europe but our kids already can't read

and write we are kids in college that

can't add

this is the death knell of america this

is not some small thing here that you're

deciding

and there's no reason these are

guidelines schools all around you hop

hog everything else

open five days this is your decision to

do in the generation

right here remember that this is the

beginning of the end of america

okay god we hope that they rescind this

but if they don't rescind this

this few years here will be known as the

covid dummies

they won't make it into college they

won't do anything and there's no reason

and anyway lastly i want to say if you

open the schools

why bother the first kid or the first

teacher that gets covered you're going

to close all of sagem

so this is all the foss all this money

the reopening programs and everything

it's all a big fuss

okay it's it because this is being

treated like the bubonic plague

mr capuano i'm sorry there's a three

minute time limit okay thank you

studies all around the world have opened

up there's not one case

the ymca tracked their own tracing 40

000 kids not one

mr kevin thank you very much for coming

we appreciate it thank you so much for

listening and i wanna say lastly

the governor said this is for us to talk

not three minutes i listened to this

young lady

for three hours that was not the

guidelines you're worried about

guidelines guidelines

the governor said the people should be

able to come in and talk

not listen to you guys tell me what to

do with my child

okay thank you very much

okay uh miss uh muchitash please

can i just start sure yeah

um hi my name is lauren mukhitash um

i've been in station for 13 years now i

have elementary age children

i'm going to jump the agenda

oh i'm sorry um

i'm going to jump the agenda a little

bit uh and

go to item 12. um there's been a

proposal

to create a divor diversity task force

in sacrum central school district i'm

here to voice my support for the

creation of that task force

sachem student body is comprised of 25

percent

racial minority students our e and l

students represent a staggering 98

different languages spoken within this

district of 13 000

students our students represent a

multitude of cultures religions and

abilities

representation matters

our multifaceted student body deserves

to see themselves reflected

in their teachers and administrators in

the books they have access to and read

and then the curriculum they are taught

so i would just

plead with the board please don't render

this to

a toothless subcommittee with no power

there are lots of things that i love

about sagem

and i think that this is a step in the

direction to improve upon

what we already have a strong foundation

for thank you

i'm sorry next is uh mr warren

hi uh my name is jason moore i'm a

parent in the community uh

sageman graduate i would like to make a

plea to the board please value and

respect

the school community by maintaining a

high standard of transparency and

communication

at all times but particularly in times

of crisis

the communication from the central

office and the board has been

unacceptable

it is essential for every member of the

school community students teachers and

families

to be constantly updated at all times

about every aspect of the reopening

process the meeting

this meeting was not advertised to the

school community at large

there were five parents outside barely

and they left

please as soon as possible communicate

the following please communicate the

following to community immediately

how will we ensure that our remote

students are receiving an equitable

education

i can't accept that they will receive a

subpar education

you've put in your email that i received

while i was standing up front says it

will not be the same i need it to be

equitable i need my child to get an

equitable education

they need to be live instruction and

ongoing assessment we need to figure it

out we need to put programmers in place

we need to figure it out it has to be

figured out we cannot make an exception

where part of our school community is

receiving a subpar education it's not

acceptable

not acceptable to me should not be

acceptable to you and it's not

acceptable to your teaching staff i know

that for a fact

secondly a building space plan must be

made available to the teacher

to the parents of this community with

individual room measurements and the

capacity to maintain

authentic social distancing at all times

and i need to know about the source of

ventilation

i need to know what the school buildings

look like if you're telling me 17 kids

in a classroom

i need to know that there's room for 42

square feet for every 17 one of those

students

i need i need that in writing before i

even think about sending my child back

i need clear opportunities for all

parents to participate in this process

i shouldn't stumble upon this i should

be knowing about this weeks in advance

i need specific criteria for testing and

tracing in all school buildings

i need a contingency plan for what

happens when the rate of transmission

rises above three percent what do i do

with my child

how do i make accommodations i need to

know these things before we put our kids

on those buses

it's unacceptable that you're asking me

to put a remote survey in place by

friday and your first parent meeting is

on monday that's unacceptable

the parents need to know what's going on

the school community needs to know

what's going on the teachers need to

know everybody needs to know

it's unacceptable please i need you to

do a better job of communicating with

the school community

most important details need to be

related to about our children's

education in the future

please address these issues immediately

the students the teachers the families

in this community

deserve at least this much thank you

thank you very much

miss favaro campbell

hi i'm michelle for campbell i wanted to

just address the board about the

diversity task force as all of you know

i started that email and requested that

it be put on the agenda and that you all

consider

creating one it's been 10 years that i

my daughter started well she's going to

be a senior now so 10 years ago i

actually started talking

to a lot of district office which is

very changed now

maybe mr scavo might have been on the

board of ed back then i don't remember

but

most of you are not we're not then um

it's been 10 years since my family

started talking about the

having more diversity and representation

within sachem and i'm really excited to

see it finally make an agenda

i want to also make it really clear that

it's about race religion

and abilities i want children in

wheelchairs to see themselves in books

in their classrooms i want children with

autism to know

that they are just as represented as

every other kid

in every princess book in every

superhero story

and i want to help show our curriculum

expand

to teach children that kids with down

syndrome can be teachers

because there are stories of preschool

teachers who have down syndrome and

kids who are deaf and blind can grow up

to graduate harvard law school and

become

disability advocates and travel the

entire world

and i right now we just don't show that

we don't have the staff we don't have

diversity in our staff we don't have

diversity

even in the books that they see when

they walk into a classroom so

i just wanted to thank you all for

putting it on the agenda tonight

and for entertaining the idea and to

understand that it's actually

bigger than one issue it's about every

kid at sagem

walking into their classroom walking

through hallways

and right now where i know reopening and

dealing with covid

but this has been 10 years actually a

little bit more

in the making and sacrum is going to go

on

long before my daughter who's going to

be a senior and my son is going to be a

freshman in high school

they're going to be gone and i don't

want to leave that task force like i

want this to

be 10 years from now every kid who's

just coming into kindergarten or the upk

program has a very different experience

than what they had

and so that's really important to me

that you all knew that so thank you

thank you miss sanders

hello everyone oh hello everyone maria

sanders

um i am a parent um i would like to

just make a statement um in respect to

the reopening committee i i was a member

of the reopening committee and i just

would like to express my disappointment

in

the fact that the committee had no part

in the actual planning

or process of of the plan that was

presented to the community

my understanding was that we would be

part of that process

but instead we had two meetings where we

were basically given

the list of directives as administration

and and

the board of vet had planned so

basically we got a sneak peek

and the ability to ask a few questions

though i certainly respect the time and

effort and energy that administrators

put in

and i will not take anything away from

that you fail to utilize the very

volunteers that you asked for

because there was a tremendous amount of

talent within that grouping

and we certainly could have helped you

in putting together this plan

for myself having students in second in

middle school and high school

i recognize that this plan is not going

to be adequate for them

and again though i understand right now

we we're hoping that the testing

standards

are loosened the value of a full-time

education will not be

and these children cannot get a

full-time education

when they're in school fifty percent of

the time they're only seeing a teacher

fifty percent of the time and they're

they're sitting home in front of a

computer

for the other 50 that amounts to 10 days

a month when normally they would be in

school for five days

a week so i just asked that in the

future

when you come to the community and you

ask us to step up

and come in and help you really utilize

us

because our voice really has not been

heard

that's it thank you thank you

uh miss williamson

nicole williamson okay

uh miss cologne

hi everyone i'm josephine scalon i have

undecided about

we're going to be towards the top of

page 14 letter h

probationary appointment of the

administrative personnel there you go

andy

can i please have a motion

motion by mr coggins second by mr wadawa

discussion

discussion um

i will be voting uh no on this in the

next two personnel

items uh my reasons are the same as

they've been for the

past several board meetings concerning

central administrative

positions that is i believe the new

superintendent should be part of the

process

in any administrative appointments uh

what i must make perfectly

clear is that these candidates as well

as those from the prior meetings

are qualified and capable of the

positions to which they are being

offered

and i would fully support them if the

new superintendent was

part of the process so this is a process

negative vote and nothing to do with the

personnel

uh the new superintendent is close

i mean we're almost there and we

certainly have qualified staff who could

perform these functions

for a short time as interims

so that for that reason and that reason

alone

i'm voting no on the next three

administrative positions

i must stress it has nothing to do with

the individuals

i fully support them and would support

them in the future mr kieran

just because you asked for a discussion

and for the public and

anybody at home by losing our

superintendent our assistant

superintendent

and our special ed director we would

have left three positions open where we

would have needed interims

and just for argument's sake mr o'keefe

what is the going rate

for an interim at that level per day

for which position are we speaking let's

say it's the superintendent

um rates vary but a going rate for

superintendent is probably

12 to 1300 a day and then what about the

assistant super

an assistant superintendent depending

upon which

position it could be 800 to 1000 a day

and an executive director of special ed

would also probably be in a similar

range

a minimum of 800 a day so what

and and i don't necessarily disagree

with your argument but what

what we did was we took a vote to have

these positions filled

we had three people doing five people's

jobs and it

between losing that on a normal year is

almost impossible but

losing it during covet is is impossible

um

and we put things into motion to have

these positions filled by qualified

people

to save that money and this is money

that i mean we we already just talked

about

taking custodians off that we don't even

know if buildings are going to get

cleaned in time now we want to take more

money out by

filling these positions with indoors i

think that that's a slippery slope if we

go down that path

well i appreciate what you're saying uh

my my

uh my position is that

a superintendent of schools uh is the

single most important person in the

district and totally accountable to us

and the district for making decisions

and to have a superintendent of schools

not part of the process even though a

new superintendent come in and doesn't

know the personnel is certainly going to

ask the qualified people who who they

are and do cement and be part of the

interview process

i i think that's even more important

than the

saving of a few dollars here and there

but that's i mean i i see i'm alone in

that position but i stand by it

i i understand where you're coming from

i just if i don't appoint somebody until

september 1

that's a long period of time at thirteen

hundred dollars a day eight hundred

dollars a day

and while it seems like a few dollars

here and there

over a three month period that we

haven't had people that

it starts to add up and when we need

money down the line i would be afraid

that

we put it on in a room is when we had

qualified people who could take these

positions immediately

i will remind you of your fiscal

prudence

soon

[Laughter]

alex just because we're having a

discussion

so mr kiernan the people that were

appointing tonight

i i have personally known all of them so

it's without hesitation

that i think that they are the best fit

for sachem i don't care who our

superintendent is

i've trusted mr o'keefe as our interim

superintendent

to make the recommendations and i

100 percent agree that any

superintendent coming in

will not find any better candidates than

the ones we're putting forth tonight

opposed motion is carried

dennis uh we're going to start with

andrew larson

so andrew just want to welcome you to

opposed motion is carried

number 11 monthly reports

so we there was a question from the

community about when the committees

would start meeting and how

i think that maybe if people that were

leading these committees

we want to maybe set some dates we could

do something virtually

i'd like to see the budget committee

start talking about if there was a

possible mid-year cut

and look into any and all options that

there was i don't know if there was

anything else that

you may want to look into but that's

just one that i thought of

i don't know about the legislative

committee if mr kiernan has anything

for the legislative committee okay

all right number 12 we are back on

public comment this

portion of the public comment will be on

any and all items that anybody wants to

speak at that's not on the agenda

and everyone will have three minutes to

discuss and like we said before

this is not a q a and a back and forth

but we do want everyone to be able to be

heard that wants to be heard

okay the first one is miss young

[Music]

oh

i press this yes

thank you for waiting for so long thank

you you guys have been outside the

season board of education members and

community

it's come to my attention that vp sarah

waterworld wore a bill

okay okay

we're a blm t-shirt at a board of

education meeting

this is unacceptable i can respect a

person's right to free speech and to

have their opinion

however blm is a political movement and

it does not belong at our border bed

meetings

or in our schools and indoctrinations

the definition of a racist is paramount

in the name of black lives matter

the name indicates that black lives

matter over the other races

this is unacceptable and this racism

does not belong

including the blm is putting itself over

our law enforcement

which many of our community are employed

and of

all races this once again making blm

a black organization furthermore new

york attorney general

attorney general james or the black

lives matter foundation to see

solicitations of new york donations

that has they have not registered as a

charitable organization

we do not know whether the blm t-shirt

that was worn

was for the black lives foundation

or movement in either case it has no

right if any

one of the board members wore my hat

supporting

trump i'm sure the same thing would

happen

the apology that was put on facebook was

cynical and scolding call us as

all races and insisting blm is not is

not a political issue

last i checked everyone in america had

the same rights regardless of race sex

color and sexual orientation

as specific cases of discrimination are

happening in our community

then we must address those issues what

offended me

is the use of rap music before sporting

events glorifying women's segregation

drug use and the cursing and the songs

with the word

and in it this is not acceptable

if we are going to talk about

discrimination it can it's got to be

used both

ways so let's start by banning that bml

not political

tell that to the murder black trump

supporter bernal

tramell furthermore the disgusting

political use of blm as an attack on our

police and blue lives is not acceptable

our community of all sects and races is

made up of law enforcement

blm is declaring war against all blue

lives matter

miss young there's a three-minute time

limit thank you thank you very much

miss o'connell

so conor thank you very much for waiting

i know that it's been a while

okay well

i am beyond angry

at what is going on with our children

okay we are not doing the right thing by

our children in any way shape or form

at this point in time whether we want to

send our children to school

or keep them home

neither of those options

currently are acceptable

i sent everybody board members in email

i got one reply

challenged every one of your board

members to go and spend 10 minutes in

one of the

one of the classrooms on the first floor

in the second floor of one of the high

schools did any of you do that

yeah i didn't think so yet

you all think it's fine obviously

that we have no ventilation in the

classrooms

for crying out loud we have to have

special ventilation in the malls

and other businesses but where our most

vulnerable are

we don't

none of you would work

in these classrooms

in the current conditions none of you

so why would you think it's okay for our

children to be in there

even before this but definitely now

now the air in those classrooms just

stands there because there's no movement

there's no nothing

and covert will stand in the air until

it falls down on somebody

so you're putting our children in an

environment

that is guaranteeing that if somebody

has gold but it's going to get on all

the rest of them

horrendous it's despicable

and now i'm hearing that remote learning

is going to be a joke that's not okay

either

okay i don't want my child in one of

those rooms

i want my child safe

but my child is taking five ap classes

next year

which means he needs a robust distance

learning program

but my understanding is we're not doing

that am i

incorrect

no okay so what we're doing to our

children

is despicable

and you should all be ashamed of

yourself

just a second mr block just a second mr

kyle i'll get your answer question right

now

i had a conversation with him

you know i know that you were asking the

question about the uh being restricted

in terms of the assembly

yeah but it's pursuant to the governor's

executive order one of the number of

executive orders

202.45 i looked i believe i looked at

that one and that was talking about

social media this is okay i'm just gonna

back up just a little bit just so we can

keep our space now it talks about

non-essential

gatherings yes and this is not essential

that's correct as long as while we're

virtual because you still have the

option of being virtual

the board decided to assemble oh

so so you guys decided this was not

essential so because you decided

the governor that's not that they don't

decide no so who decides

well there's based upon the governor's

orders the governor said that this is an

honest

the governor said that we can conduct

this meeting virtually or yes you can

yes but yeah so as long as you can

conduct it virtually

meeting is considered to be

non-essential because you have the

ability to be able to connect the

virtual reality

okay thanks thank you for that

it's mr black so

202.45 it was extended by 202.53

and it's in effect until august 20th

okay

next fury

good evening i'm a proud sacrum

educator and a parent of three daughters

who attend

sageman schools i'm here tonight to

voice my concerns regarding the

secondary reentry plan

i have a daughter in eighth grade and i

also have a senior

i have grave concerns regarding the lack

of an equitable education for our

secondary students

these children will suffer the

ramifications of this decision

in which they will only receive 50 of

the curriculum

for years to come in some instances

this decision may change the course of

their adult lives

i don't want that to happen to my

children and i don't want it to happen

to anyone else's

i implore you to reconsider this plan

and attempt to find a way

to make the secondary re-entry plan more

equitable

so that our chm students can receive 100

of the curriculum that they are entitled

to just like our elementary students

thank you

that's all

23 board discussions the first one we

put on today

uh was an adoption of the 20 2021

calendar

there was a talk of a change mr o'keefe

yeah it's just you know something i want

to bring to the board's attention

because obviously

administration has been meeting with

district administrators

as well as our teachers looking

at the opening of school and just trying

to be sure that we can be as prepared as

possible for whatever that is

other districts have taken a look at

this and also

um chosen that option each year a

district is allowed

up to four superintendents conference

days our current calendar

has three uh the first two uh are

in september the september second and

third days are superintendents

conference days

um and the third one would be on

election day november third

we've been discussing the possibility of

having the board consider the ninth

which is wednesday

i'm sorry eighth which would be the the

first day of school for students

to be a third superintendent's

conference day

in september uh that would give staff

teachers administrators everything all

the time that they need

to be sure if there are those last

minute tweaks changes to classroom

setups

changes to schedules assignments

whatever the case is

you know i had a lengthy conversation

with mr barbara last night

you know his guidance counselors are

ready to dive in to do whatever work

needs to be done to make

our secondary experience as good as

possible but we need the data first

so once we have that data we can dive in

on this we don't have much time and time

is not on our side

um so for your consideration um

we'd like to talk about adding the

eighth as a superintendent's conference

day

would we have to remove another day off

the calendar for that

we would just convert that date to a

super i wouldn't alter the calendar

right now

other than that obviously since the year

hasn't even begun

uh it still keeps us within legal limits

it still leaves us the flexibility if we

were to have a

severe winter um you know maybe with the

new reality of

our ability to switch between distance

learning maybe that can even help us

you know in bad storms and things like

that where we might be able to turn

something like that on and

not lose instructional time but i think

giving the staff

that extra time especially since we're

down to the wire

uh you know could be helpful now on the

counter side

obviously families are already starting

to make plans they're ready to send kids

back on the 8th they've already made

decisions

they've arranged child care whatever the

case is so it isn't just as simple as

you deciding

let's re-adopt a calendar and maybe it's

not even something you do tonight

maybe it's something you consider you

think about

and maybe it's on the next agenda for

the 26th but i wanted to bring it to

your attention

to give you some time to think about it

and talk about it um

you know is it a possibility where we

could consider that day

uh for additional staff planning does

anybody have a question about the

calendar

i'm just thinking we're gonna make this

decision we have to make it tonight so

parents do have enough time to make

arrangements mr bauman

can you um what kind of professional

development day would it look like what

would it look like

well it would be a useful day for the

teachers too yeah it's not a none

i mean miss heinz can speak better to

the professional development days none

of them are going to be like the normal

professional development days i'm sorry

i didn't mean professional development

superintendent's day

would it be a day that the teachers

would be able to kind of get their

stuff together yes we so

i mean as we've been saying our teachers

have been working hard all summer

ongoing professional development this is

really more honored space for them so

they can continue to clean up get things

ready make sure the google classrooms

all their lessons are in place

so not our traditional you know ad camp

style superintendents conference days

but we recognize that it's a tremendous

amount of work to get started

does anybody have any other questions

does anybody want to vote on it tonight

or did you

was the request made by the staff to

have that extra data to get ready

it came through a conversation you know

administration and staff have asked for

it

so i agree with sarah the earlier the

better i would agree as well

we can vote on it right now all right

motion to change the calendar to the

eighth being a staff development day

second by miss volpe all in favor

opposed the calendar is done get that

information out to families as quickly

as possible

the next item up for discussion

is future board letter writing this is

something that i personally put on

i i don't think that

we should be putting letters out to the

community if

with all of our names on it if we don't

agree with what it says

um and i could be in the minority on

that but i'm i would be fine with

writing a letter

putting spaces underneath and letting

those who agree

do it now most times it's a nine nothing

and there's no issues

but um you know i personally didn't

agree with the letter that got put out

and if my name is going to be on it

especially admonishing another board

member i have to agree with it

um and that's just the way i personally

feel about it

i understand that we're a body and i get

that but

at the end of the day it's our name and

we have to put our head on our pillows

and if we don't agree with something

i want everyone to have the freedom to

not only say that but be able to

just to live with the decisions that are

made and to be able to

stand up to the community and say here i

did this or i did not do this and

have a straight face when you say it i i

just i didn't agree and it's my fault

for

you know ever putting my name on that

piece of paper so i just i want to put

it from here on

out if anyone has an issue please feel

free but if whatever letter it is we

write the letter

our names are on the bottom and we can

sign the letter if we agree with it if

we don't

we take the space away and then you

don't have to sign it if you don't want

to

but at least you can you can make your

own decision and you don't have to feel

like you're beholden because

maybe it's only five people who agree

with it and five out of the nine agree

and now all of a sudden it's a board

decision

and your name goes on it no matter what

jim

so uh how do you determine

whose name is going on suppose four

people want the letter out is

is that sufficient to send the letter

with four names

that's uh that's why it's up for

discussion so i did it so it's got to be

a majority

take to even have the letter go out so

five members have to support it

and then let's suppose it's a 5-4 the

letter does go

out board of education and the five

members who agree with it sign it that's

i'm going to

see that if anybody had an issue with

that i i just wanted to address it

tonight so that

we haven't had a chance to get all

together in a room so so let me express

you on the opposite end of the spectrum

if

four people want to put a letter out and

it's a four or five board

the four people be able to put a letter

out because the way that when you sign

up for the board of education you sign

up as a group

okay and you vote as a group okay and

hey listen there are things that

happened in the past why i was on the

no side of a vote where i got dragged to

the mud but

i signed up for that yeah you know so my

my impression is that

five is a majority and and it's what

moves resolutions and it's what

moves you know uh you know uh

different different uh incent you know

initiatives and so on and so forth

so so i think the easy way to do that is

that

when you're getting attacked by a

community member okay because of what

the letter says

your response is look the board the

board majority voted on it i don't

necessarily agree with it

you know if you have concerns please

contact the rest of the board you know

right and that's how we leave it

just just my just my personal opinion

this i happen to disagree only because

when we

pass let's just say the new principle

for sage of north

in the in the minutes it will reflect

that jim voted no

it's not going to vote that yes we voted

yes but if you go look in the

in the back to it jim can say i i i said

no

and he could say anybody to the

community and here's why i voted no

and he could put his head on his polo

and he's fine like it will not reflect

that i said no

and and just like i think it's wrong

that you get dragged through the mud on

stuff that you voted no for and you

can't even back it up because

there is no record of you ever saying no

unless you look through certain things

on votes yeah but if it's a letter

there's no record of anybody saying no

but if the letter's coming from the

board of education

is it coming from the board of education

is it coming from five board members

i mean i so i guess my point is i don't

think we should be writing any letter

that's admonishing another member

i mean most most letters are in

agreement to the state saying we need

our funding to the state saying

we don't agree with certain things that

they're doing but we should

certainly not be or

so um and and maybe mr black you can

answer this when we

get elected to the board of education my

voice

means nothing more than anybody sitting

out there my voice

only means one as part of us nine

we i have no say i can't decide anything

i have no more decision making

than my neighbor next door my my only

input or influence comes as as

a board of nine so the letters that we

had done previously

like supporting our seniors graduating

in person

or the denouncement of betty devos as

the

education or denouncing racism that was

issued as a board not as me as an

individual

so i think legally mr black if you could

just give us some guidance here

that when the board of education of

sagem school district

issues a letter i think it has to come

from the board

if laura slattery who who lives in

wisconsin

wants to send a letter to governor cuomo

then i signed my name laura slattery

not laura slattery ch board of education

trustee

and and that's i feel that me on this

board

i'm not a republican democrat

independent anything

i am representing a community of 55 000

registered voters

my personal opinions or anything i feel

personally

does not matter when i'm sitting here

with the nine nine of us

my only thing that i can do as a board

trustee

is in as a majority of this board unless

legally you see something that's how i

feel i was elected by the voters

i was elected by my sachim community i

i feel like i have to represent my sagem

community as one of nine

not as laura slattery individual and of

course i don't think that's

being suggested um but um we're a

governing body and every

governing body around the country

operates that way you operate as a body

you're elected to be part of this body

you make decisions as a as a body there

may be

differences of opinion that's part of

our democracy that's what makes our

country great

um you'll be able to express those

opinions at the end of the day you have

to make a collective decision

and then you have to abide by the

decision that that body makes

one possible solution is that

um if you are going to issue a letter

and there's concerns

that um dissenting

members vote is not going to be known

like it is when we take a public vote

you can take a public vote to send the

letter

and then you can adopt that letter as a

majority vote those who dissent are on

as a matter of record they're on they're

on record if that's the case

so so you're saying that no one member

is allowed to remove their name from a

letter

i would say that that's not typical

practice that you would see

but is it legal for a member to remove a

name

um well if the when your letter is going

out

um i don't think it typically sets forth

all the names i don't know

i don't really like to say it has it

printed all your names on the left side

it says

there's a list of all the names and on

the bottom it's the president's name so

on the left side of the letter

it has all of our names listed yeah but

that's your that's your letterhead right

yeah lists all your names it doesn't

indicate whether or not you voted for

that

letter to go out or not it's you're

represented on that letterhead it's an

official

board of education stationery that's why

your name is on there it's not signaling

that you voted for that or not

but the recognition is though that when

you do take

a vote or when the board puts out

material

that that's so so that's a fine that's a

compromised

decision i think that any and all

letters should be discussed in public

and voted in our public

that is a concern that you have that's

one way of addressing it yeah i i was

just going

i was just going to say that that sounds

like an excellent idea and that really

just goes back to like you said about

my vote you know is on record and your

eight votes are on record

for these fine individuals here so that

would be the same thing

we discuss a letter you know we take a

vote on it

yes if it's a majority vote the letter

will go but the dissenters

are also in the minutes i like it

and i'm 100 in agreement with that this

way

it's a public discussion anybody can

look back but then we still

are issuing a letter based on a majority

of the board but as long as there's a

record of who votes yes and who votes no

i'm correct

i am 100 fine with that

just one statement and me and laura have

gone round and round about this before

but i want to

i want to make this point look we're all

elected members to this board

as any elected official is if i want to

write a letter

and i want to sign my letter bill cogan

board trustee sachem

i'm 100 within my rights to do that

it's a matter of opinion as to whether

or not i should do that

if i want to get together with four

other board members and each one of us

want to sign it as board trustees once

again we are within our rights

to do that all right it may be perceived

as a bad idea by this board

but there's nothing illegal about it

okay inside it's not a vote i don't

think we're going to take here i just i

just wanted to make sure that we

discussed it and there was at least a

public

so that all future letter writing is

done in public and just also just to add

to it

it's been customary that at the bottom

of the letter the signature block states

the president's name

on behalf of yeah just signed the letter

sincerely

the sachin board of education and not

place the president's name on the bottom

of the letter

okay uh the last item up for discussion

is the diversity task force

so as you guys know i gave you guys all

an outline about

what just got a little bit closer sorry

i gave you all the um an outline

probably in the end of july and i

don't know if you all got a chance to

look it over

yeah i shared it with the board again um

the other day sarah so i would just like

to

like make a motion to put it on to vote

tonight on establishing this task force

yeah i mean my my only issue is and i

don't have a problem with this diversity

task force but

the way community committees are usually

done is that

we could vote to establish one give

direction to administration to come back

as to what the charge is going to be

talk about the charge and then approve

it um

i i i would say that that's that's

probably the route we should go

and in the years that have been on the

board we establish construction capital

projects committees and

you know some are established for one

specific job and then they

they they disappear and that was for um

one of the uh

you know construction projects that we

did um after that we didn't do any for a

while so we didn't need that

organization but

i would say that we we either vote on it

tonight yes we want to

pursue something like this we understand

what the end game is what we're trying

to achieve

and then um normally what happened is

administration would put together a

packet

of a pamphlet that's made available to

the community

they could download it in a pdf format

people would sign up for it

submit in the same way they would for a

budget advisory committee you know or so

or you know any other thing so i would

just say that we we follow that format

you know and and you know we're not

adopting

exactly what the world no but we're

establishing a diversity task force

and and charging administration to come

back to us with what the charge is going

to be

i would have no problem with that

any questions everyone

all in favor of i'm sorry yep uh i read

the whole thing like

lots of times i think it's great you

know we need it here in saturn

all in favor all right any opposed

mr picariello this still uh one visitor

that we had called wasn't here at the

four children

severe nut allergies

viral induced asthma

just go

with this my kids are fine they will be

homeschooled

and they will be homeschooled well what

about

all the other children that aren't as

lucky as my kids

how come nobody is talking about them

how come what nobody's talking about the

children getting hit

at home how come nobody's talking about

the children that aren't eating

at home how come nobody's talking about

the children that aren't learning or

being sexually abused

at home nobody cares about those kids

i hear a lot of things how we're

emptying the rooms

and there's going to be nothing in there

no one's allowed to touch each other

no one's allowed near each other we're

not

we're teaching our kids to be scared i

was scared for a long

time i've been hurt i've been scared of

allergies and a nut killing my child

fear cannot run us we need to stand up

for who we are and what we believe in

and i believe all our children deserve a

fair

chance at life and we are not

giving it to them
