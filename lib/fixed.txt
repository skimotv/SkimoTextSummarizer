Thank you very much
 is [Music], read the congratulations, so,,, visitors
, everyone rise for the pledge and then remain standing for a moment of silence with liberty and justice for all
 Thank you [Music] good evening
 Everyone, as you can see, the board of education is attempting to return to some form of public meeting, which is also compliant within the limits set forth by the governor's executive orders and the guidelines of the cdc and department of health
 We must limit the number of people permitted to be physically present as a part of We compliance with those obligations
 Perhaps the most important item for We meeting tonight is a public discussion about the reopening plan for september, as it pertains to the reopening plan for september
 We hope to have answers to most of your questions as part of the presentation, but may also need time for the administration to research, an issue on occasion
 You can always email the superintendent with the question as well
 I am also aware that some attendees may wish to speak about matters related to conversations that occurred on social media and the role of the board of education
 In that regard, if you wish to speak, be sure to fill out a card and give a card to the district clerk
 There will be two opportunities for public to speak at our meeting
 The first is limited to comments relating to agenda items only
 We will then move through the agenda after We complete the agenda items
 A second opportunity for public comment about non-agenda items will be provided
 I ask that all present be reminded to be respectful of one another
 The administration and the board of education
 Also the opportunity for public comment is just that public comment
 the board of education will not engage in debate or back and forth with the public during the period of public comment in an attempt to provide all who wish to speak an opportunity to do so
 Our policy limits comments to three minutes
 There may be people who wish to speak, who have been left outside due to space limitations
 ask security station at the doors for a card and people who wish to speak, who have been left outside due to space limitations will bring security station in to the district clerk again
 While we respect the community and we always want to provide people with the opportunity to be heard if things devolve into personal insult or invective as the president, I will entertain a motion to adjourn the meeting
 I thank you all in advance for your cooperation to start tonight's meeting
 Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe are going to make a presentation about Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe reentry plan
 miss florio
 Could you fire up the cameras for us all right just give Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe a moment
 While Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe wait for that and while Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe're doing that, I'd also like to apologize to those from watching from home, because, unfortunately, obviously from that distance you're not really going to be able to see Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe screen
 So for that Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe're very sorry
 You know, unfortunately, the limitations of how many people are in the room you know have Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe been able to move the room to an auditorium
 Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe certainly would have done that, but Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe're limited to a total of 50 people or 50 of a room's capacity
 Whichever number is lower, so, unfortunately Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe're at that 50 capacity in the room this evening
 This document, Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe're going to show tonight again is another evolving document
 Back on the 31st, Mrs heinz and mr o'keefe placed the district's plan on the website, as required by state law
 the district's plan on the website had to talk about three different models for return, which the district's plan on the website did since the district's plan on the website was posted on the website
 You may have seen additional commentary from our governor where our governor has since changed some of the parameters, such as offering additional opportunities for choice for family and or for staff
 So we need to take those things into consideration
 So again, this document and the presentation you're going to see this evening is the most accurate as of now, but this evening by far is not completed at the conclusion of tonight's meeting in this presentation, you're going to get a copy of this presentation emailed to you through the school messenger system, this evening'll also be up on social media and this evening'll, be up on the website, you're, also going to receive an invitation to participate in a survey regarding choice
 It's a follow-up to the survey that our sent out last week, where our asked potential preferences, this one's going to need to be more definitive where our actually need to know which families are looking to have families children receive instruction at home versus those that are willing to send children to school
 So without further ado, I'm going to ask miss heinz to start our off
 Thank you, mr o'keefe
 So this morning our actually concluded and had our last committee meeting, which culminated in the plan that our're going to be sharing with you tonight and, as mr o'keefe said, all of the community members will be receiving at eight o'clock a phone call to this manner and also the plan and the survey for remote learning
 I just want to thank all of the folks that were on that committee with our
 our are made up of several community members unit leaders, staff of all sorts, and it really has been a pleasure to work with everybody
 Excuse me one second, while I got this on, so after a tremendous amount of feedback that our received from our survey from our community and given the lengthy documents that our have given out and the models over the past few months, I can happily say that our are able to offer a full return for our elementary students k-5, as well as a full return for our students with disabilities, our special class, which would be our 15-1 classes, our 12-1 classes and our 8-1 students, and at the secondary level due to size and the fact that, because our will need to reappropriate space at both levels, elementary and secondary, our will have to move forward with a hybrid model for grades six to twelve, and that will be an a b schedule based on alpha and household
 The reason why our were able to offer a full return for our elementary school is because mr o'keefe and myself and our instructional directors and our director for facilities and the building principal began walk-throughs
 Last week
 our walked through each and every room in our buildings to space and measure at six feet
 On the average our are able to fit about 17 students in a class
 Now again, know that our have scheduled a full return with our total population, so with any remote instruction that would diminish the amount of students coming into our schools, so our would actually have even more room because of the re appropriation of space our needed about one extra section or one extra grade level k5 at each building generally, so our are going to be utilizing space in our libraries in our arts and our music rooms and other common areas, which our'll talk about a little bit later on remote learning is something that, as you know, Last week, it was confirmed that our will, as districts need to be offering this to our students as well
 This will be a parent choice and a consent tonight at eight o'clock
 Again, when you receive that plan, there will be a survey in there and we ask that only parents who are looking to remotely instruct only parents who are looking to remotely instruct their child child fill out the survey, and it is due
 It is a fast turnaround by friday
 We need to be able to staff and schedule the remaining students that We have coming into We schools, remote learning again, that is by a parent's choice with consent and at this time it is a decision for the entirety of the 2021 school year
 I say this now because, based on the number of possible staff who may also look for accommodations, that might mean staff members staying home in conjunction with our students, our need to match up to see if our have enough staff members who are going to be able to offer remote instruction or should our have to look towards live streaming
 If our do not have enough certificated staff that matches up with the number of students, and so therefore our would not have possibly a physical space for students to come back to
 If that were the case, should, of course, all restrictions be lifted through the governor's office, then our would have to, and hopefully would have a little bit of time in between
 our would just have to restructure and reschedule to ensure that all students are able to return remote instruction will entail
 It is not like being in person school and It is not distance
 Learning
 Distance learning is only going to be offered
 If, again, our are ordered by the governor's office to remain at home
 All students and all staff remain at home, and that would be live instruction for two and a half hours on google me that would be k12
 Remote learning is different
 This is, more asynchronous learning with possible, live or streaming teaching happening throughout the day
 This would also be a schedule that would look a tad different based again on the number of students and how we would need to support everybody, but we just did want to be
 You know fully upfront and present about that
 we also know that devices for we we are not a one-to-one school district
 we have definitely made some strides and we are in the middle of major infrastructure work that is going on
 we just did order about a thousand new chromebooks in order to be able to disperse for families that do not have any technology in families that do not have any technology in their home at all home at all, but it would be difficult for we to provide a device for every student in families that do not have any technology in their home at all home should families that do not have any technology in their home at all be on remote learning
 So that would be something that the family would also have to consider
 Students will be expected to complete all assignments daily and any students, obviously with disabilities on remote learning, would be provided all of Students accommodations as per iep
 As for their iep okay, it's important, I'm sorry, it's important to just also talk about the secondary hybrid model for six to twelve
 On your a day, let's just say, you know, for the sake of just explaining it to everybody, it would be a combination on on a day
 You would be in your child would run their traditional regular schedule
 their would leave with homework and any work that would be on their google classroom for the next day that their are home, while the teacher is then teaching the other second half of the class on b
 Obviously, our teachers are committed folks and our teachers would be checking in answering any questions within that 24-hour period, but we would expect that at the secondary level, again, kids will be making sure that all of kids assignments are completed and kids are, and kids are present
 Attendance is important as we move forward in this school year
, now that we shared with you a model of how we're looking to return we students, I think it's very important that all families and community members now we staff knows about the health and safety measures that we are putting in place, and we continue to look to put more in place as as time goes on, masks will be required for all staff and students, both in school and on the bus
 Remember that the bus is an extension of school, any students are having any difficulty wearing a mask for medical reasons or because of a disability will need to submit documentation
 As always, always would affirm this with always building principle or through the office of student services
 Mass breaks will be provided because remember in our classrooms
 our desks are six feet apart and in the regulations
 Children do not have to wear a mask during instruction
 our would encourage, of course, that masks be worn at all times, but that does give our the opportunity to give multiple mass breaks whenever a child does need it, while they're being instructed masks are to be worn, though, however, in the hallways cafeterias, if they're not eating recess any other common area that our would just want to be safe,, our also every day
 I'm, excuse me
 bus travel will also include, as I said, before, social distancing practices optimally
 our will be looking for six feet spacing and encouraging family members to sit together
 Every day, parents and staff will be expected to fill out an online health screening survey and in this presentation, when you do receive an online health screening survey, you will see a hyperlink in there that you can see a sample of what it looks like ahead of time
 our are also
 our also took time to ensure that at arrival and dismissal, varied entrances in all of our buildings will be sanctioned off to separate grade levels
 If they come off of the bus, our are also looking to take off the grade levels at increments of time off the bus
 So everybody is not coming out at the same time so again, just looking to work ways to have plenty of flow while classmans may not look typical, especially at the younger levels
 You may not see some of the rugs and some of the the other items, the kitchen items, things like that that you would normally see
 know that our classrooms will be warm and inviting like our classrooms always are, because our classrooms teachers will be there
 their teachers principals will be there and our will still be able to decorate that
 our will just not be able to decorate that with things that kids will be touching, because that would need to be sanitized every day
 our classrooms will be devoid, as I said before, of any of those items that may collect germs
 our are in the process right now, of setting up opportunities for our teachers to continue to clean out our teachers our teachers own personal items, and our are also moving out any unwanted furniture that our don't need in the room so that our can maximize the space hallways and other common spaces are being marked appropriately to ensure social, distancing, so markings on the floor items around on the walls and that's also shared later on in our presentation
 So you will be able to see it at home as well
 When you open up the link hand, sanitizer stations are located throughout each building, all along the hallways
 our will also be having all along the hallways at the elementary level or any other area for gym cafeteria time when, at the secondary level, all along the hallways're able to go out so as children go in and out, all along the hallways can use a hand sanitizer as all along the hallways come into school
 All of those
 You know, welcoming areas would have a hand sanitizer station as well and at the elementary level
 our would expect that the students, because our do have sinks in every room they would be washing they hands before and after snack and before and after lunch
, so continued on
 As I said earlier, our have reappropriated spaces at the elementary level and our are in the process of doing the same walkthroughs
 Now in the secondary buildings
 We know it's going to be very difficult, especially for the cafeterias to be utilized the way that the cafeterias typically are, because children cannot sit in those tables together
 So moving in some desks, looking at classroom use all of those different types of things, but really at the elementary level
 our will be using again if our're going on full return for all students
 Right now in elementary school, our would be looking to utilize our music space, our art space, and so therefore, those special areas become pushing for our students
 our have worked with those departments and our'll continue to work to make sure that those departments have everything that those departments need for those departments lessons and equipment
 Cleaning of all buildings will occur daily in the evenings in each classroom
 our will also provide hand, sanitizer, wipes, gloves and any sort of spray bottles and wipe offs for for our staff and or students who feel encouraged to clean in between applicable filters have also been changed in our classroom events
 our will also look to open up our windows and our doors where our can
 Obviously you know the reverse was safety making sure that your doors were always locked
 Your windows were always closed
 Now, our're being encouraged by the department of health to please use fresh air when possible
 So our will look to do that prior to it becoming too chilly up
 Isolation areas have been identified in our buildings, and so, if a child is a child has any sort of of symptoms or they come to school and they have not filled out the health screening
 they would be placed there so that we can offer a temperature check and make sure that everything looks okay before we send they down to they classroom hygiene protocol visuals will exist in all buildings if they're not there
 Already and again I share those with you at the end of we presentation so that you can see those
 we will also be having routine hygiene drills much in the same of how we have regular school building drills at this time
 Unfortunately, no visitors will be permitted in our schools
 we just cannot provide enough secure measures for we staff and we students, and so again we will be limiting all visitors
 Both traditional fire and hygiene
 Drills will be conducted elementary snack and lunch will be in the classroom to minimize flow and secondary lunch
 It may be in the cafeteria and alternately in the classrooms
 we will also rotate any outdoor areas so for recess any of those other matters classes will be rotated on the game field, the basketball court, let's say, for example, and in we playgrounds students, are encouraged to bring our playgrounds students own water bottles
 we do have bottle filling stations in all of our buildingswe 
 we water fountains, unfortunately, will have to be closed at this time
, so just some additional elementary return details that we wanted to share with you
 You know it's always tough to start with health and safety, because again we don't want it to sound, like we students are returning to jail, but we do want to make sure that we students and we staff feel safe for the return
 But know that, on top of everything that we are doing, the social emotional well-being of we students is of the utmost importance to we, as well as of our staff, and we have surveyed students and we are looking to survey further the rest of our staff to just find out what are some of those underlying issues or concerns that people have
 So we can ensure that we have we mental health staff there for supports
 Unfortunately, we we will have to stress that students may not share materials
 At this time, students will be assigned students own independent, math, workbooks and guided reading baggies will be provided weekly so that we have time to interchange students out clean students up and leave students for the weekend, so that there's a two to three day lag before the children pick up a new baggie and in those items we will integrate
 As always in our literacy and our math, our science and social studies, topics whenever possible, this will be in addition to the strong direct instruction that our classroom teachers provide
 Already all all students will be benchmarked for all all students ela and all all students math to identify all all students present learning levels
 Curriculum will be retard as needed
 We definitely know that this will need to occur for math, and We have provided some slides in the past that show you that We're fortunate We created We own math curriculum here a couple of years back and We know the the one to two units that each grade level will probably need to go back to so that, if I'm coming into second grade, I'm certainly not going to be able to start on my second grade
 Math curriculum I'll need to be re-taught, some of the materials from when I was in first grade and for literacy
 Once the teacher knows the collective levels of what they have in they room, they will be able to accommodate those literacy
 Lessons around that art and music will be a push in again to minimize the flow, and we are currently working with we art, music departments
 This is one that was a really tough hit
 Music has to be 12 feet
 Apart for any coral or any sort of wind instruments, we are working we hardest with the department of health
 we are very fortunate here
 we have a very strong music program and we do not want to see that diminish, and so we are looking for ways to think out of the box in order to be able to offer course opportunities that might be in smaller sections and different ways to offer lessons as well, but we have provided and are keeping all lesson areas in the elementary schools, so that students can still maintain lessons as needed
 Physical education will be a mix of separating two classes
 Typically, that are adjoined, so one class will be in the gym
 One class will be outside and inclement weather One class will rotate between the gym and in the classroom
, butel and miss mcentee have reworked butel and miss mcentee curriculum to ensure that all team sports will be done in the spring, so all of those units will be taught in the spring and in the beginning it will be more personal
 Fitness
 Traditional grading will also return for our students
 While we know that there may be some interruption in terms of what model we students may have to face, where we hear rumors that we may have to go to distance learning sometime later in the fall
 we fully believe that by using google classroom no matter what we will be able to make that seamless transition to distance learning should we need- and we are well prepared, as opposed to when the crisis first happened, and most school districts were really just grasping at straws, but we also know that the accountability is something that is very important to we students very important to we community and especially to our students who are at the high school level
 As I said before, google classroom will be utilized for communication at both the building principle and classroom teacher level
 we really want to make sure that parents are on one medium so that parents can see any communication, email messages, lessons etc, and at this time we are going to enforce, to ensure for the safety of we staff and other students that any sort of instruction that is done on google classroom or virtually that our students adhere to our district code of conduct
 When students this year sign on families sign on to look at schedules, families will be asked and prompted to sign off on certain measures around this
 I just wanted to share with you some of our pictures that john and I took as our went around in our walkthroughs
 These are some samples of our our elementary classrooms
 Again, These're, not decorated, yet, of course, but you can see that These have removed a lot of the traditional
 You know, wonderful items that These would see in a classroom, but again These really wanted to maximize space and ensure that the teacher had space in the front of where their smart boards are and then also making sure that kids had room and were not
 You know pushed up too too much, so These still are adjusting that once every single classroom is created at the building level, These will be returning mr o'keefe and I, with These team, to just ensure that everybody has space both the teacher in the front of room and then students around
 So again, These are fortunate here
 These do believe that These have enough staff to move forward and should the numbers for remote learning ensure even more flexibility
 These may be able to open up more sections in These elementary schools and at These secondary levels, bringing back more secondary students
 This is at one more of the elementary school and to the right there
 You will see a classroom at the secondary level

 This particular sample is where These marked This particular sample the a and b desks, so that students will be sitting and then This particular sample will make This particular sample a little bit easier for cleaning at night for our custodial staff

 This is this is also a little bit of a tough share here, because I know that we've been getting a lot of questions about child care and upk
 First, child care: we are still going to be providing am npm child care by boce by scope, educational services
 child care continue to offer right now child care throughout the pandemic for our essential workers, and child care are happy to move forward to offer this services for all of our students
 At this point, though, our are on hold for our upk program, and that is not because our don't have the space or our don't want to, but our simply have not received the allocations yet from the state, and that is how our are able to run our upk program
 While our do have many students who do a tuition based into our upk program, it is simply not enough to substantiate our upk program
 Should our not get the allocations, so our are advising parents at this time
 I know I've
 I've answered many phone calls many emails if you are need, if you need care, if you would like your child to go to an alternate preschool now is the time to seek that out just to be safe
 However, if our were to find out about the allocations tomorrow, our would also be able to implement that
 You know moving forward, so our have not changed anything our're not changing any spaces at this time, our're just kind of on a standstill but to be safe
 our just encourage you to look just in case
 Excuse me, ms hines, yes
 Actually, since our last spoke earlier today, I spoke to mr duffy, he's the executive director of scope and runs our upk program just trying to see if he's heard anything further about our upk program and he has not heard much more than our have
 As a matter of fact, there was a meeting earlier in the day with the suffolk county, superintendents, as well as mr wix who's, the regional superintendent for eastern suffolk boces, to see what boces knew about upk funding and again their contacts in albany have been very, very quiet on upk funding
 The only information their've received is, you know, floating a balloon from albany that their're considering opening upk up, but their may only fund upk funding at 80 percent of what the grant would be
 So that would mean if the district wanted to move forward
 That would be an expense that was not budgeted for and we'd have to make a determination
 You know to take those monies from elsewhere to support our upk program, so it sounds like those monies're getting closer to a final decision, but I'd have to keep the border prize, so the border prize might be a model in which we'd have to support 20 of our upk program to make the border prize move forward
 So I'll keep you posted on that
 Thank you, mr o'keefe,, and then on to now our boces cte program
 So those are our students because our do have two
 our have cte programs that our house our
 cte programs that we house ourselves will still remain on the a b schedule, but the but the bose cte programs, where students get on the bus and go to Boces
 Boces did alert our last week that cte programs that we house ourselves will be providing that in house cte programs that we house ourselves do have the room so that will be live every day and for those students our will still have busing from our high schools to and from our upk program
 our at this time, though, say that our may need family support in terms of if your child might need a ride to school if family support are going to our upk program in the afternoon or alternately
 That is, that is not solidified
 mr o'keefe and mr savone are looking at that through transportation to see if Mr o'keefe and mr savone might be able to accommodate and pick up individual students at Mr o'keefe and mr savone homes
 That would only be for those choosing remote learning right
 Only those choosing remotely
 Thank you,,
 So here I just
 I share the hyperlinks that you will see on on the presentation that that we've sent home for the sake of time, I'm not going to go through all of these links, but the top is a sample of we health screening form and the bottom of our all the protocol visuals a sample of these links that we have smattered around every single building and so for we next steps
 As we said this morning, we finished we planning committee meeting where we laid out the the final steps here with we district leaders and we volunteers
 we board of education, pres presentation is, is now as you can see, and then we also have a live community forum on monday at seven o'clock and we will be live streaming pres presentation
 Similarly here, however, I would envision that we would be a little closer that so that you can see we a little bit more clear, but on friday we will be sending out a survey just asking community members for questions that community members have
 we will collate those into subject areas and we will look to we best answer
 Any questions that you have as well as we building administration will be delivering a common q, a sort of like fact sheet about further details pertaining to to the buildings, and this will include sample schedules for all of our students- orientations how those will go out for our grade six on our grade nine
 Some of that will be virtual and some of that will still be activities just broken up into smaller increments at the building, as well as arrival and dismissal times and bell schedules for secondary students and then, lastly, as governor cuomo had ordered on friday, we are in the process of updating we district website for protocols for any symptomatic individuals testing
 we are not responsible per se for testing we, but we are responsible for offering a plan
 Should a student or a staff member go home, a student or a staff member are required to go, get testing where that could occur, and then, of course, a student or a staff member can't come back into school until testing results have been provided and then contact tracing as well

 So that is the end of we presentation this evening
 we look forward to speaking and sharing some more and clarifying more for you, as the rest of the night goes on and then on monday, as well at seven o'clock
 Did I my apologies
 Let me go back
 I I didn't realize that I think I got caught up in what we were saying about upk before, so my apologies
 These are some additional details about our secondary return and again, with the utmost priority being the social and emotional well-being of our students
 In grades
 Six to eight we will be benchmarking for eli
 we do that through a literacy management system that we have and also for math
 All of we math departments have benchmarking type assessments that All of our math departments do in the beginning of the year and again this will be to identify present learning levels in grades, seven to 12 curriculum adjustments may be made for applicable areas where prior learning needs to be had so, for example, in our math and our science classes, there may need to be some learning from the prior year's regents bearing class, and so we would be looking to look at curriculum around that and possibly offer review classes for we students as well again, traditional grading will return
 Students may not share, so we will be limiting textbook use and we'll be taking advantage of all of the online subscriptions that we have physical education again
 Very much like elementary school will be a mix of the gym outside fields and other large area use instrumental lessons very similar to elementary
 we are working with that department to ensure that lessons will occur
 that department do need to be 12 feet if that department are wind and or choral in nature, and again we will be looking to figure out ways in order to still offer those choral groups, but in a modified version google classroom will continue to be utilized for communication with both the principal and the classroom teacher again for a seamless transition should we ever be ordered into distance learning
 Lockers will mostly be used for am and pickup only that's not to say that if a student really needed to go back, we would not allow a student really needed to go back to, but again just trying to minimize the flow and minimize how much we students are putting into the lockers
 So we would envision some form of outerwear, that's appropriate for that time and modified or or very
 You know slight binders and or folders notebooks that they need stagger grades again in times of at the end of the period
 we would be announcing grades so that grades can come out into the hallways, so that would mean that we would be at the end of the period starting it a little bit earlier, so that we can allow each grade level to disperse into the hallway to grades next period
, sorry about that
 So that still is the end of we presentation
 we hope that this did clarify some further information for you
 we are appreciative of the support and the time that the community offered we to be able to digest everything and wait for the orders, so we can bring this to you tonight
 Thank you
 Questions from the board questions from the board
 Is anybody, jim, a john on the upk right now
 The way that's funded is
 Correct me
 If I'm wrong, like a six hundred thousand dollar grant, primarily we get a six hundred thousand dollar grant
 we hold a lottery that allots 252 families a spot in our upk program we have more interest than that annually, but families beyond the 253 are able to participate for the same rate, which is about twenty four hundred dollars per family for the year
 So if, if governor cuomo would give us 80 percent of that, that would mean that the district would have to come up with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars correct
 But are you in that hundred twenty thousand dollars
 Are we counting that that the lottery people are not paying tuition
 That would still be the lottery people not paying right, so, in other words, the 120 000 could be reduced if the lottery people were willing to pay a tuition fee
, that was a model the board chose to go with
,, thank you just to figure back on what security was saying if they were to to to
 Take twenty percent of that we'd be looking at about 479 thousand
 Two hundred is what we'll be looking at, which is what accommodate 201 kids
 You were saying that you were concerned that we, we might not be able to raise the funds to be able to
 You know, manage our upk program and have enough you know what I mean
 You'd have to redo the lottery
 Then I I wouldn't I don't know
 If would necessity, would you want to use the same number then cut the same number off
, I set off at just 201 and then and then open the same number up at 237
69 per per family per month
 we could examine any model that the board wanted to take a look at
 Certainly those other families had already been notified that those other families were among the families chosen for our upk program
 That's the worst
 The worst case scenario would be correct, but let's say those other families take all the funding and, and those other families don't and one of the concerns to have all the funding I mean have we thought about reaching out to some of we state elected officials, flanagan or doug smith, to find out if those other families can get we clarification from governor cuomo's office as to whether or not governor cuomo's going to fight, we can certainly continue to reach out
 Quite honestly, during much of this crisis, much of those other families have been rather silent
 we haven't been able to get a lot of information
 governor cuomo isn't sharing much with other people other than when governor cuomo decides to put it out via press conference, I mean
 Normally, our local representatives are very helpful in getting information for our local representatives
 Unfortunately, hadn't been able to get information for our local representatives, but it's certainly worth trying
 I mean our local representatives're two weeks before the start of school and you've got 252 families, not knowing whether or not 252 families have a pre-k
 I mean I don't know, you know how the board feels, but I personally think that you would get 252 families, even if you would get 252 families took all 599 000, because at 237 a month for half day pre-k, it's still a great great opportunity sure- and I can't and now more than ever and and would be willing to work with we if there was zero funding and we had enough participation to still run our upk program
 would can our local representatives include something like that in the survey sits some of the families out there to see what the interests would be
 our local representatives could do a separate survey
 I wouldn't want to you know not on the same survey
 put it out as a separate survey, specifically targeted to those families that are already in the process
 I have a follow-up to that
 Where are we putting all these students if we classes are maxed out at this time we still have not reappropriated our classes
 we do have a couple of buildings because of additional special education sections that we needed, that we moved the classes, but we have not taken away those class spaces
 Yet so, if we were to go with the will of the board to you know, put out a survey and go with a tuition base, we would be you know all set to go: hi
 I just had a quick question about the bus and what is the busing going to look like I mean again, it'll also depend on participation
 You know we put out a survey to the parents a week or so ago
 I think we had nine thousand respondents in in very brief order
 in that survey about a third of the families considered, possibly keeping the families considered children home of the two-thirds willing to send their children in 65 of those said their children would use the bus
 The other 35 said their children would drive their children children to school
 So just some quick, math you're only looking at say, 4 500, kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers
 I mean kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers could change when kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers put out the new survey, and it could be that you know parents first stop that kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers don't want to use the bus and then during the year
 Maybe kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers start
 You know kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers need the bus
 So kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers're not reducing the number of bus runs
 All the runs that have been budgeted for would be running, but with those numbers you'd end up literally with just about one child per seat
 You know so and then you also take into account remote you'll get routed for 44 students
 So in the worst case scenario there could be two pupils in each seat, but based on the information kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers're receiving, I don't think there'll be that participation
, just some clarification so with the custodial staff cleaning each night, so the custodial staff're going to have more to do than the custodial staff did prior
 Have kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers increased the custodial staff since the custodial staff job description will be different to do a more deeper cleaning every day daily versus
 Unfortunately, that was one of the items that was pulled back on the budget, so obviously kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers may need to take a look at that again kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers were rating 10 custodians and then, when there was issues where kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers even today, kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers still don't know what kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers state funding is and kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers still have the potential of a looming
 20 percent cut, kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers decided
 If you remember back to january and february, kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers were talking about this
 kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers were adding one extra custodian, each building right
 That was one of kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers enhancements for this year's budget
 kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers did draw that back, so kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers're going to work with the custodial staff
 kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers have work with the substitute staff kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers have, and you know man it as best as possible to optimize cleaning, and then with the secondary schools, where you have the a b desks next to each other
 So that means, if I am an a student and I sit in only the a and then the next day, the b desk comes in
 That image might change, though I was going to say that that was really more so that kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers can show a visual to the families, how kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers were spacing it out in the beginning, those desks kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers would see needing to be reappropriated and put into kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers lunchrooms different other areas where kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers're going to need to reappropriate other space, the library different items like that
 So I don't
 I don't necessarily think kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers were just at north today and in the classrooms that kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers walked around in with miss trombetta
 There was only about 15 to 16 desks in in each classroom: okay
 That was an initial setup when kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers were trying to figure out what it would look like or how kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers could divide them up
 But in fact, with the style of cafeteria tables, we have it
 it really prohibits the number of children that can eat in the cafeteria
 kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers believe kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers're going to take all the cafeteria tables out of those secondary cafeterias and store all the cafeteria tables and put in desks
 I mean it's not going to be the most attractive
 Lunchroom it'll be set up more like a testing room where children will be spaced six feet apart right with classroom desks correct, but kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers do anticipate that kids interested in using the bus based on those numbers would be able to offer breaks, for you know, students to be able to go outside and go into any of the recreation areas, items like that elimination and so then in the secondary schools
 If the kids are changing classrooms will the b desk get wiped down between each change or how does that work in the cafeteria
,,, not in the classrooms that would that would technically be not possible
 I mean there's 3 000 desks in high school and 1600 or so in in a middle school
 That just wouldn't be the means in that four or five minutes of passing to wipe down those tables
 But if we student would want to do we student own destiny, the materials will be in the classroom right
 We are providing that for every classroom
 and then one last question
, everybody
 It's okay
 If a staff or a student happens to test positive, that would then be reported, and then the cdc would guide We on what We had to do or We have We own plan
 How does that work
 The department of health, the department of health department of health
 So The department of health, the department of health department of health would tell We so if it's one student in one classroom right that may be different than a student in a middle school who passes through a hall or mrs clayton's, become an expert on the matter
, so the department of health and and the new york state and the federal requirements require us to make reports for certain things and the department of health and and the new york state and the federal requirements require the medical treatment provider
 The doctor who's performed the diagnosis for a positive result to report information to reporting for contact tracing
 So therefore, We obligation we go above and beyond to make sure that, even if, for some reason, the medical treatment provider has not contacted the contact tracing, we will just check you know belt and suspenders that we have provided some insight in case there's an instance
 The other thing is when the lab results come back
 the lab results are supposed to be also provided to the contact tracing, at which point the department of health would be or enter cdc would be contacting tracers and determining who cdc would contact, including students or staff or family or whoever cdc came into contact with
 Can I can I pick you back on that question quick
, thank you very much so on the checklist that we do daily
 Let's just say rob and I are in a classroom and I find out that he test positive for covid the next day when my parents are filling out the check sheet and it says, have you come in contact with anybody
 That's tested positive
 Will that prevent my entrance into the building
 If you're saying you tested positive, if you're saying you're tested right
, I mean, I'm, not gonna, tell you that rob testifies we're not allowed to tell you I mean I came to learn it
 it becomes common knowledge of who it was, and now I have to honestly fill out the sheet I mean I'm have to now have to say
, I did come into contact with some of the department of health guidelines for close contact, and this is where it gets a little squirrelly because you know, are we in close contact
 Are we in close contact
 Their criteria for close contact is less than six feet for 15 minutes or more, so we'll have to look at each of those one at a time, and I can foresee the department of health as soon as schools open, you know, becoming overwhelmed with calls from districts all around the state just trying to get feedback and answers, so we're building criteria and protocols with we nursing staff with we personnel staff
 You know, so we can make some of these decisions on we own
 we have handled situations already, even during summer school programs
 So it's not that we're unfamiliar with how to do it
 we've had staff members with with covid, so it's just going to be on a bigger scale
 Now, that's all, and also just to mention, block is with we this evening from ingram and smith
 He has been we one of we main contacts that we've been triaging information between the state, the federal, what we have in we schools, what we can do and what we can't do and trying to find the best scenario for we students and we staff and we'll continue to do so, and I promise this is my last question
 So if a parent chooses the remote learning,, a parent have to commit to that for the year
 a parent can't change a parent mind like after the first marking period, a parent're committing to that and then a parent student cannot participate in, let's say spring sports,, so, I think in in the beginning of the guidance, it said that students may not be able to may not be able to enter into activities or sports
 We know now that that is not the case and that if a child is remote, they're still a student of ours, We're not really going to have any activities
 So We don't foresee that being an issue
 So it's really more for sports, but miss trombetta who sits on
 The community
 Four section has shared with us information in terms of how they're looking at that language and how us would not be prohibited most likely from keeping children back from sports in september, and then the child plays a spring sport and then come the spring
 Sports are up and running and you tell the child Sports can't play, and just know that when us write that us're looking to make it more of a commitment that could be up to a year
 That is because us don't want to give the misnomer that if a child says well, I want you know a family to say that a family want to be remote in a week and then a family change a family mind
 a family want to do it another week
 We will look at each case, but it would be very challenging for We to bring back large numbers of students who think who feel a family might have made a poor choice, because that would shift all of We classrooms and all of We teaching staff
, I would totally agree with that
 I just didn't know if it would be like after every marking period reevaluated, but if the parent does commit, I just don't want to hurt the student of course by saying
 If extracurricular comes back in spring, the parent made this choice in september, and now you can't participate right and- and I think for We, you know being just of mine- that things could shift very easily
 We could look to look at that come january and it may not need to be a year-long commitment, but We did want to write it down so that parents were aware all right
 Thank you very much
 Thank you for sharing this with We
 I have two questions or concerns
 When our own plan was developed to return to school k through five the ada b day, our own plan wasn't based on surveys that went out as to the number of parents that think parents would choose remote or not choose remote
 our own plan was based on our entire population
, so conceivably, if our have a, a 6 through 12 model of a day b day, hypothetically every parent said, I want my kids to return to school
 every parent can
 every parent can accommodate all of my kids in an ajb day
 You mean physically back into school
, every parent wouldn't be able to do that
 How would every parent physically bring them all back
 every parent don't have so at the elementary level, just very simple, math
 every parent have to take out about five to six, seven kids out of each classroom in order to be able to accommodate that average size
 My question a little bit on the six through twelve model--,, it that was based upon returning every single child to school
 So if friday, the survey is if we have if we have more children now I understand you
 Thank you
 So if we have more children who are going to be on remote, we could conceivably- and I know we discussed this this morning in we committee- we could look to bring back more students
 My question is that my concern is the same as laura is having a one-year commitment
 I received a half a dozen phone calls today,, probably in the last couple hours about I'm concerned about the one-year commitment we know
, that you know in remote learning it says remote instruction is not equivalent to in-person hybrid instruction right, so it's not the same level right so for forcing kids out of school
 What we're doing is we're creating a bigger educational gap for the following year
, we're not forcing that would be a parent's choice, but the thing is we allow a parent to come back after each quarter
, if we're able to accommodate a parent according to the way our own plan was designed
 Why wouldn't we allow a parent come back after after one quarter, so a parent can get that
 I didn't think we said that we wouldn't be allowing we said that it would be really prohibitive for we to be able to reschedule a parent back into classrooms, but we could look at it based on the numbers that we have
 we wanted to be honest, mr scavo, and let families know that this could be a year-long commitment, and most districts are looking at that at either january or the year long, because it is very disruptive that would mean having to up just move around the entire schedule for
 You know our schools, which our may still have to do, should covert restrictions be lifted, but you wouldn't want to recant, and our know that that happened quite a bit where, in the beginning of all this debacle, our were putting out information and then something you know, alternatively, was shared, but I think our just said before with miss slattery, that, of course, if our could look at it by quarter and our felt like it wasn't going to be a tremendous feat for our families that our would do that
 But I think that that's not probably what a parent is going to make a parent choice on if I'm choosing to be remote
 It's because I'm thinking that it's unsafe for my child to be at school
 So I'm hoping that by these presentation, slides that we have people will see that we've made tremendous tremendous
 You know strides in making sure that our schools are safe, our schools're, clean and we're doing routine protocols to ensure that, but the commitment is a year
 That's what this time for right

, so if something changes at home a person, that's furloughed now has to go back to work right, our schools want to and our schools our schools impression is going to be that our schools can't return because our schools signed the paper saying that our schools have a one-year commitment to be at
 But I mean I think, though if, if there's something along those lines- and we all get those calls all the time, if there's a family, that really is in enough need and feels like there's a family made the poor choice or not a poor choice
 there's a family made the wrong choice for what there's a family there's a family thing is
 Going on right now, so whether a parent goes back, furloughed or there's a family child is just not doing well in remote learning and there's a family were to contact us just like any other parent phone call that us would have
 Of course, us would look at every case individually, but I'm talking as a whole
 us could not say you're going to be a remote and then, if you choose to decide in masses that you want to come back, us just would not be able to run the same schedule and then us would be restarting everything over again
 The reason why I bring this up is: I watched the the newsday webinar yesterday us had dr johnson
 I finally heard all about dr johnson
 I got a chance to see dr johnson in the presentation, along with a psychiatrist along with a the superintendent of north babylon, and that exact question came up right and a lot of the experts were saying
 I would not go past a semester
 In fact, a lot of districts are going quarterly, you know- and I just don't
 I just don't want to influence a person's decision because a lot of districts're fearful that, if a lot of districts sign the paper a lot of districts're not going to be able to come back because the reality of the paper is, is that you know when we look at the education of even a day b day
 My concern is that, as a teacher, you can't teach the entire curriculum and now we're talking about prior learning being re-taught from the previous year, how you and you're never going to be able to teach the the entire curriculum, but the kids that at home that are not getting the same
 Equivalency of education are going to be further behind the following year and which all we're going to do is create a a snowball effect and that's My concern
 I mean you know I personally would like you know the opportunity that, if they, if they come back after, if they're the first quarter, which is a 10-week period or nine-week period, I think it would be a little more settling for the people in The community
 Knowing that all right, this remote's not learning I committed to a year now, I'm stuck well, I mean, I think I think two things right, because I agree with you
 I don't think anybody wants to be in the position where we can't welcome back students interchangeably as students need, and we definitely know that, no matter what happens
 Curriculum is going to be interrupted this year
 That is a safe bet right, but if we play, if it's the will of the board, if it's the will of the board to change that- and you would like to make that language more flexible, we're happy to do that
 But know that we've taken, you know quite a concealed amount of time to making sure we would prefer we students not to be on remote, but if a family really chooses and needs to choose that we honor and we respect that absolutely
 But, I mean nobody wants to do that, but nobody's the size of sagem either, and so we have different restrictions
 That's why the question was the plan design based on the entire the question was
 the question was based on of if all students were going to be a full return, then we would have to go in an a b day if we are finding, though, that we have remote students at a quantity where we can bring back students even an additional day or or by grade level seniors
 First, ninth graders
 First, you know
 However, we look to plan through that
 Then that's would be we next step
 So just like what we were saying earlier in we remote instruction, it's going to be hard to match up what exactly the model will look like until we have the survey results from we teachers and for we families, so we can match it up certification-wise
 My biggest concern is we have kids taking ap exams and getting kids ready for that and getting kids ready for the next level college
 You know we
 we have training as much face time with with staff
 It's absolutely
 I agree with you and I'm very I'm very thankful
 You know working with the scta if we ever have to think about distance learning the fact that we'll be providing two and a half hours every day for we students so running the same schedule, just shortened periods
 You know working on google classroom interchangeably now and consistently across all of our classrooms
 You know just right now
 Currently we have a tremendous amount of teachers that are undergoing pd, virtually to ensure that everything is is up and running and that teachers that are undergoing pd feel clarified and supported in that kind of work, but you're preaching to the choir
 I couldn't agree with you more that this is a really challenging time
 I have a high schooler myself and she's in a smaller district, doing an a b schedule
 So I scratch my head a lot right now, so I I completely respect and understand and if the board would like us to look at the year-long date, just let us know and us'd be happy to accommodate
, this this will go the, remote learning actually just went out
 That survey just went out, but us can I mean I could send That survey on on
 On remind in five minutes, if us wanted to say you know that us've changed the date, but it sounds like
 Maybe that needs to be more of a discussion if us're looking to go that route meredith engine and then jimmy so on the remote learning
 If a parent were to choose that model, I understand that us would want a parent were to choose that model to commit for the full year, because us are devoting staff just to that remote learning right us're not using a teacher who may be inside the classroom, sometimes us're going to utilize the staff that, for whatever reason, has to be staying at home to be our remote teachers
 That's the optimal plan right, so at the elementary level, it works a little bit easier in that in that fashion
 If I'm an elementary teacher and I'm out, I can conceivably teach any of those grade levels if I'm a librarian, obviously that certification, et cetera et cetera, it gets a little trickier at the secondary level, because if I'm a chemistry, teacher and and I'm out- and maybe I don't have as many students out for chemistry- you know- then what am I giving to that teacher in terms of work that as many students would be doing for that day
 So one could say that that teacher would switch what as many students're doing and now as many students're going to teach more science electives and as many students can support any of those students who are out needing science electives
 So it's really going to boil down to looking at the hard numbers of students matched up with the teachers that we have
 Should we not be able to match everybody up which I'm hopeful we will be able to, then we would need to start entering into some sort of live streaming or larger groups of google classrooms, where a teacher, instead of having a class of maybe 25 or 26 in a google classroom, we may have to have larger numbers, and so then that's why the year-long decision, or not doing it every quarter becomes very challenging for we
 If I'm a teacher and I'm running a google classroom of 45 kids and now some that those classrooms want to go back, what classroom are what classroom going into
 Where am I fitting what classroom into so then you're having to change people's schedule
 It's a lot of moving parts, it is and then, if, so we have so children are able to through children parents, choose whether children want to come back to school or not
 Our teachers are not electing whether Our teachers're coming back to school
 The the teachers that are staying home to do the remote learning are the teachers that have reasons why The the teachers that are staying home to do cannot return, and so, even if tomorrow, you know three weeks after school started, all of our remote learners said well
 This is for the birds
 I don't like This
 I want to go back to school
 We wouldn't then have the ability to bring them back, because, even though We did the classrooms for them, We wouldn't at that point, have the ability
 Would We well not at this time, because again, with six feet, We are, you know down to the amount of numbers that We have, but if, if We numbers look as such, where the remote learning is a larger quantity than our elementary classrooms, let's say, for example, instead of our numbers look as such, where the remote learning is a larger quantity than our elementary classrooms being 17, that might only be 13 or 14
 So then We could start welcoming our numbers look as such, where the remote learning is a larger quantity than our elementary classrooms back, but that would be based on almost you know, looking at each student individually and being able to see how We can schedule our numbers look as such, where the remote learning is a larger quantity than our elementary classrooms back into school, which is probably a very physical impossibility in the next three weeks
 It's a little hard with our secondary schools as a as a secondary mom
 It is it it kind of does stink and there's no two ways about it: our children, no child, is going to get the best education this year
 It's just not going to happen and something We're going to try We best We'll
 Definitely try We best right
 If one, let's say somerset had an influx of you know
 80 percent of their kids wanted to stay home and remote learn that would open up a lot more room, but it wouldn't necessarily mean that We would do somerset where their children win every single day and the rest of their
, We would be making decisions that are consistent for all students, but then We might be reappropriating staff to help out in other ways in other areas, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but it's okay
 That's why We're here We're on the spot
 Have We looked into sixth grade at all, because in my opinion sixth grade is that lost grade
 It's a grade where they're a little too young to still stay home by they and not only just stay home for the day by they, but also teach they kind of you know get on this get on the schedule get on the computer
 Do what you got to do
 Keep yourself moving on that b day
 Have We visited something that once We get all We numbers, because I know We can't really finalize anything until We get all these surveys and numbers, but once We get all those numbers, are We going to be able to maybe look at sixth grade going every day as a possibility
, that's absolutely you know, that's definitely a conversation that we've been having as as soon as we know what the numbers are
 Will we be able to welcome back additional grades, and I would I would assume that we would be having these conversations with with all of you, we administrative team, obviously as well and sixth grade is one of those that was a really hard thing to kind of cut off at, because we know that we would be having these conversations with with all of you, our administrative team, obviously as well and sixth grade is one of those that was a really hard thing to kind of cut off could be 10 11 years old going into school, and I would not feel comfortable myself at times, leaving my child home for long periods,, and so, we've had those conversations and once we know the numbers we'll be able to come back and report if we're able to make any changes good
 Thank you
 So much, no problem, just a quick question
 Some clarification
, piggybacking a little bit on what mr scavo said
 Are we entering the year making an assumption that we're not going to be able to deliver 100 of content in regards to secondary curriculum
 If that is the assumption that I think you said that we're almost entering into, I mean who's going to choose what topics and what's being covered
 Are we letting different teachers different people it just it concerns me that we're entering, I know, there's no perfect answer and there's no scenario that can right that, under these circumstances that you've, given you but
 I guess that makes more of mr scala's point is that if we're making the assumption that we're not going to be able to deliver content, we should be trying to wait till so many surveys come back and see how many kids we can actually get and
 So no, I don't have a perfect answer for it, but I can tell you what we're doing to set up for that
 I had a chair meeting a couple of weeks ago, so we instructional leaders in each department to talk about that, especially at the secondary level, and so we would be looking at we curriculum at what are the big ideas at the end of the school year
 What is it that the students are expected to learn so the students can
 You know move forward and pass those classes and or regence exams, we're also hoping to have a little bit more guidance in terms of the state education department in terms of what they're going to do in relaxing standards and curriculum and testing so much in how they had canceled the regents
 we don't hope for that
 we hope more for choice so that these students, who are working hard getting grades attending, will be able to at least have a choice for regents
 If these students, who are working hard getting grades attending, will be able to at least have a choice for regents want to take it and see what kind of grade these students, who are working hard getting grades attending, will be able to at least have a choice for regents get, I don't, I don't think we're looking
 I don't think- and I know you mean it this way, but we're not assuming we're not going to be able to get through our curriculum, but we want to be real with we families
 our curriculum could look a little bit different than what our curriculum normally does, and I know our teachers again hard workers are already looking at that
 we've had some conversation, for example around science lab hours, usually that's seat time now the state education department has relaxed that, and that could be also a virtual
 So we've already started those conversations once we come back into
 Schools in we department means that we've been having anyway, virtually we'll continue those talks and start looking at that together
 So this at the secondary level state the new york state, creates the standards for apn regions right so haven't
 Given we clarification, okay, ap is through is through the college board, and so we actually are, starting, as you know, a new ap capstone program at the high school, so those teachers that are gonna begin teaching it for we this year those teachers that are gon just went through the training for that and right now, ap is holding tight to what those teachers that are gon're doing, but we also know that at the last minute those teachers that are gon made some changes around what those teachers that are gon did: testing wise, virtually
 So we are advocating- and I think mr o'keefe spoke about this earlier- while we have not heard a tremendous amount from we legislators at this time we have been advocating, through we local boces, we associations talking to talking to the college board and just hoping for some teamwork for relief, so that families know that you know we're not looking to make any decisions that are going to make impacts for the students, but we also have to be real and the students have to work with we
 So we're hopeful for that
 No problem, aaron, the so by the weekend we will have the figures on how many people are opting for remote learning
 Is that,, all right and the way we have it now is they're being committed
 they can make a commitment for one full year, just just for my identification
 Let's suppose it came back to say 30 percent of our district, one, which could be right, which could be what it could be sure
 What does that change
 Anything for us with the ab days or or or as alex laura meredith said, the sixth grade situation would, let's say, 30 remote for the year
 Would that change
 You know what us're doing right now
, absolutely so what I just said with business
 Also gonna take you know
 Where is the thirty percent
 It could be heavily weighted on the younger children
, you know, is a k12 pet families deciding they want to keep they home right
 You know it really depends on the breakdown of the of the groupings and the grades of where that 30 percent is or is that 30 percent leaning more on one side of the district versus the other, it's not as clean as just if that 30 percent was thirty percent, but, spaced across our district
 That would make it easier
 We can see some movement, I'm just not sure that I could say for sure right now that it would be at the secondary level
 We would just need to see where it is and just aggregate that and just look at it, and it also boils down to to you know certification areas too, as well
 How much staff We have in in each area
 I fully understand mr scala's position on that
 I really do understand, but I'm trying to trying to look at this, as if you put out a survey tonight which is already gone, but if you put a survey tonight which is already gone out- and a survey tonight which is already gone said your one mocking period and you could change your mind, then kind of I would say that you really we're stuck with what we've got this is
 This is the way it's got to be because you don't know from market period of marketing period, how many students you're going to have
 Is that accurate
 I mean, but, but that goes to back to what we said
 we can't put out there that you can make the decision after each quarter
 If we're not sure we're going to be able to offer that- and so I know it may have looked like it- was a little bit stricter than it sounds like the board was- was willing to move forward with and so again we're certainly open to putting in alternate language, and we could send it as as quick as you know, as soon as we're done here or first thing in the morning
 I certainly don't want to prohibit anybody from not doing remote learning but again, it's it's
 we have to be practical in the size of we school district, so we can't say we're going to be able to offer things that smaller school districts can right away, but it is prohibitive based on on the numbers
 So,, we might be able to offer that and we might be able to offer more grades into we secondary schools
 we might be able to offer more space for we elementary students
 we just won't know until we see all of those numbers getting to getting that number that we're seeking this weekend will drive where we go next,, and that's why it's challenging to be able to share with we staff and with we community what remote learning will you know essentially look like as well
 If I don't have enough staff, I can't guarantee that you're going to be in a google classroom with a live teacher
 I might not be able to offer that it may be based on whatever elective or store or grade that you're in it could be some sort of like a live streaming, but but again it really
 it depends on on the numbers of the students that we have up against we as well
 Thank you, jim just just real fast to pick it back
 I apologize
 I walked out for a second, if only 75 of the families respond to the survey
 So now there's 25 of the kids
 We don't know what the kids're doing the default is that the kids're coming to school
,
 Thank you no problem, so I know with elementary the teachers
 Usually take the kids lunch when the students have their lunch
 How are we working that, if the students're having a lunch in the classroom who will be supervising the students so
 we do have obviously aid support
 we are also working with we principals because we know that we're probably going to need some additional help with that, but we also know that
 You know that lunch is managed
 I actually thought that there was some staff that was a part of the lunch periods that might be mistaken
 I'd have to look at that, but we are
 we are having conversation to ensure that we have the support we need for lunch, two more
 Actually
 What will clubs look like virtually
 So that's that's another new and exciting question right
 we definitely know that clubs are not going to be able to be maintained after school physically
 we have started to work with an online platform called passport for good and an online platform called passport for good allows clubs to run virtually and note on all clubs activities attendance community service hours if a child is working any of those types of hours
 So we have to enter into conversation with we teachers about what that could look like
 we certainly don't want to not offer clubs, but you know once a week twice a week: what sort of activities
 How will you meet with you know once a week twice a week: what sort of activities
 Will google me be a part of it
 Those are the questions that we're looking to have moving forward around clubs and one more with the staggered start times
 Those are students still changing for gym class
 we will not be changing for gym and we will not need to because we have moved team sports to the end and we're looking to do more
 You know personal fitness that isn't rigorous, but we would not
 we would not be looking to have any any
 You know contact in that manner for our students [Music]
 As I sat here tonight
 I thought about saying absolutely nothing and I really don't know where to begin
 I don't have a specific question
 I can tell you that I'm incredibly angry internally right now and it's not at anybody in this room, but I thought that, I haven't organized my thoughts completely they're
 Just bouncing around in my head, but I want to say a few things
 First, I want to say that you did an outstanding job in the most difficult of circumstances
 You've put together a plan
 Every school district is in the same exact boat that we are in questions asked tonight by rob, alex laura meredith everybody here great questions, and we don't have the answers to any of those questions and we are going to be surprised
 I think greatly by the things that we find
 I think that you know people could look at what's going on here tonight and people may think that all of we agree on this model and think that this is what we have to do
 I'm sure there are people watching this tonight streaming or we'll watch this later on and they'll think that if you're sitting here, I'm sitting here and I'm quiet that I must agree with this plan- and I think it's wonderful and I'm going to tell you that I don't it's rotten, it's a rotten plan
 That's going to do tremendous damage to our children
 I've been teaching for over 22 years
 Now I can remember when I started there was goals 2000
, maybe some people in the room
 Remember that maybe you don't, then there was no child left behind and then most recently there was common core there's, never a time in which it seems like a bad idea, can't come about a bunch of garbage and nonsense that does anything but improves the education of our children
 As I sat here tonight and I watch that slideshow and I watch those desks sitting so far apart
 I thought what kind of dystopian period of time have we entered into where we look at this, and we accept this as the quote-unquote, what I hate to say the new normal, it's not normal to me
 It's not acceptable to me
 I want you to know that if it were up to me solely, I would defy the governor
 I would send all of we children back to back to school
 I would give all of our children that opportunity
 I believe that his edicts are completely unrealistic in terms of delivering a sound education to our children and I believe his edicts are not well-based in terms of research and data and so on
 So when we look at how many children have ended up with covid and what's happened to how many children, there's no question that covet exists
 In my mind, I lost one friend to it
 I almost lost a second several who had it very badly who thought how many children might lose how many children lives
 So there's no question that covet exists
 However, when I look at the numbers and when I look at children getting covered, what I see is that we response is disproportionate to what is going on and we are willing to just fall in line and listen to the leadership of this state, this country and do these things- and I know there are people who feel like me, and I know there are people who don't feel like me, a third of the survey respondents who have said I'm not comfortable sending my child to school, and I am all about parental choice
 If you do not feel comfortable sending your child to school, then I encourage you not to I encourage you to homeschool
 I encourage you to use the remote option if you're not comfortable with that
 However, I feel, like I've, been denied my choice, which is to send my child to school
 I'm willing to tolerate that risk based upon what I know, because I think that the damage being done to my child that still is in in school and the damage being done to other children is tremendous
 I taught remotely for the last what three four months of school and when I tell you that I did as good of a job as anyone could do with live instruction every single day
 All right
 I worked very hard to do what I did and I watched kids slide into the great abyss and some of those children that I watched slide are supposed to go off
 The princeton this fall are supposed to go to
 Cornell are supposed to go to
 You know you name school and and school're going columbia and so on
 But yet I've watched each one of school slip and I've watched a few hold on, and I've watched the most needy students that I taught completely slip, we're not getting that back
 we are not, and here we are and here's where we're going so I'll leave on this particular note
 Sometimes it's real easy to just go along and I feel terrible for people like you, folks, the administration here, it's simple and I'm in the same boat as an educator
 It's my job
 It's how I support my family and live my life and as a result of that, I'm forced to comply, because if I don't I'm out of a job but the solutions, we've come up with my family're, not good solutions, my family're, terrible solutions, and my family are solutions that are going to harm each and every one of we children
 And at some point I do believe that people who feel the way that I feel are going to have to think long and hard about how we stand up and demand what we want for we that we think is best
 I just want to say before I ask my last two questions that was well said bill
 I I feel exactly the same
 we do so well said
 I just want to talk about the boces, because we're also feeling some questions today about boces
 As I mentioned earlier in the meeting community meeting where there was only 50 people in that meeting,, where there was only 50 people, there was 50 how many people 50 volunteers and then all of we staff as well go ahead
, you know
 Having worked for boces for going into my 29th year, you know over the decades things change school districts go to block schedule
 Kings park did at one point: school districts for financial purposes, decided that you know we don't want to send two bus routes to boces
 we only want to have one route and, as a result,, we basically said to we agency look whirly standing in the am this year, or will whirly sending seniors in the am and juniors in the pm and seniors've changed things so that it accommodated whirly and we bosses always accommodated whirly and my concern with some of the questions with some of the students that are in cte classes, that are that are scheduled to go to carpentry and auto body, and- and you know whatever other programs whatever other programs signed up for- is that transportation becomes an issue if we have an a day b day, those particular subject areas you have to be there every day you can't teach somebody how to sand the fender and paint the fender remotely
 It's just not something that can happen, so I suggested earlier that maybe we should call boces, eastern south post and say look we pay anywhere from 14 to 20 000 tuition depending on the particular student
 If they have an iep or not or if they need additional services, we can only stand in the am because of the situation
 we're in you know and get they feedback
 You know, I don't believe we
 I don't think they want to lose the tuition
, I agree and and uh- and you know I did appreciate that idea, because I'm not I I know you're in western but it was just you know, shared with we, the model that they were running, and so we traditionally we're share we're told what we schedule is, but we are quite large and I agree with you- we pay an exorbitant amount of money into both season
 It's certainly worth the conversation
 The second thing we have in-house cte classes where we have cosmetology, and- and you know using the same concept- I mean if we have to get we kids there every single day
 The suggestion that you know we've we've done in you know boces is that we try to allocate you know: the junior students first year, students the am session this way the junior students could take that bus up every single day right and just have to get a ride home two two days out of the week and then the pm students or the second year
 Students would actually attend cosmetology and pm because many of Students may have driver's license and license
 It's just another suggestion to be able to accommodate that population of kids
 That really need to be there five days a week, especially cosmetology students that have licensing and all that stuff which, by the way our cosmetology teacher, I mean she
 she really just went above and beyond to ensure that our kids there had the experience our kids there needed, even if it was virtually
 So I agree with you and I do appreciate that feedback and then just the last thing is more of a more of a comment and it's frustrating because you I hear what bill saying I hear and if you don't mind, I really do
 Mr coggins, I
 I don't want you to think or anybody to think that our just you know, laid low because of our jobs

 I think everybody knows I came from a district where our stood very tall against things that were coming down from the state education department
 I think when you're talking about health, health's a little bit challenging, but I hope you understand- and I hope everyone in the community knows that at no point did
 I think that I was doing this just because it was my job but because I really do want what's best for children like
 I know all of us here, but I stand just as equally frustrated when you're out and you see people out and about in playgrounds and beaches and and whatnot and our're held to you know very different standards
 But when I tell you that our're working 18, 19 20 hours to make sure our're given the best, I know it's not what we all want, but I do respect what you said and I really do appreciate that feedback
 My last thing is really more of a statement and
 You know when I look at the guidelines for opening in new york and it seems like they print a new one every week, because they change the rules so crazy,
 You know you look at they
 If I can say that you know john, when you said it was cryptic, it really is I mean you need to you know you can interpret this 50 differently
,, but they have a mandatory column and then recommendations for best practices, which I don't understand, but it talks about ensure that social distancing, six feet at least six feet or a physical barrier is maintained between individuals while in school facilities on school grounds, including cafeterias, unless safety or care of activities such as moving equipment or elevating elevators traveling in common areas requires shorter distance of individuals
 But then number two says: if social distancing is not possible, individuals must wear acceptable face governments, that's exactly how we interpret what we talked about earlier if we have to move kids back into a classroom
 The way I interpret this- and maybe legal legal counsel, give me you know this- and maybe legal legal counsel opinion right is that if we had to move desks closer together, to be able to not be able to, you know, accommodate the social distancing by putting masks on the kids, we would be able to do that and that's exactly how we started out we planning
 If you remember we had looked at, I think it was the massachusetts model where we were looking to at least go no less than three feet and when we did that it was like everyone's high fiving each other everyone's coming back
 This is great and I don't mean to put block on the spot, but we did receive guidance from legal and it looked as though that masks were not going to be appropriate alone, but we read the regulations the same as you
 It was just as disappointing when we found out that was not to be mr o'keefe
 The other day, you'd mention that if we were able to go three feet, we could accommodate every student
 Every kid come back
 Every student we had every building make up a class for three feet, and so we were able to say that if parents felt safe for parents children to return that we were able to do that we hands are very tied
 In terms of that, and you know again, I don't mean to put you on the spot, black, but you may want to jump in then it was a few weeks ago where you know we thought that just mask face covering was going to be sufficient
 If you couldn't maintain the social distancing, but then the governor's office came out and clarified that and said that you have to have that physical barrier and
 So that then took away we what we thought was we ability to have face masks, but the face coverings are okay in the hallways and the bus
,,, there's

 It's not that's
, nothing makes sense, but that is
 That's that's what we're following so aaron
 As we all know, I should have had a swivel chair, john I'm just saying
 Should I have a swivel chair, as we all know, education is is not going to be pretty this year and we want to give we children as much as we can and we've spent so many years working on this educating the whole child and worrying about social, emotional
 I'm, the most emotional person shouldn't be talking about this, but
 So a couple of things, our most vulnerable, social and emotional
 As we see little children adapt much better
 You see a two-year-old in target with a mask on it's, not a problem
, my teenagers find the mask, uncomfortable and, and so hours
 Six through 12, in my opinion, are our most mentally vulnerable and I just feel like, because things are so different
 Are things going to be able to just go down to the guidance counselor just go down to you know, or things like that like, where things want to just go
 Take five minutes with the guidance counselor or even the school psychologist
 Is that still going to be fully in place opened to everyone
 Is there also
 I know that
 I know that over the the distance learning period last year that our sagem north sel chairs they our sagem north sel chairs they did a tremendous job
 Having a google meet also are are things for mental health in place and then my other question is what does recess look like in in covid land in elementary
 I think, because I think I lightly brushed over that
 So I'm glad that you asked me about that because you know so last year was the big thing that our were taking away: five minutes from lunch and recess and uh, there's always bigger fish to fry people
 So, with that our sagem north sel chairs they're gonna be allowed to go outside our sagem north sel chairs they're gonna be allowed to run it all off
 Are our sagem north sel chairs they allowed to play on the play gyms
 Are our sagem north sel chairs they allowed to play ball with one another, or is it you're going to stay there and just run in place and you're going to stay there and run in place and
 I mean, I think
 Realistically our sagem north sel chairs they are children, we're going to do we best to set up so that it's a safe environment, but there's not going to be boredoms out there if our sagem north sel chairs they are playing ball
 I can't tell you that we will our sagem north sel chairs they're going to be, as I said earlier, rotating between the fields that we have the playground equipment that we have and then the basketball courts, so we would obviously have equipment outside for that
 we do have sanitizing stations that we will be utilizing for the students but again
 You know, as I said I think in the beginning
 we do not want we students to come back feeling like we're in jail, and the first thing that we had on we slides was the social, emotional well-being of we students and I'm very proud of the program that we have built here, and we are just looking for unique ways whether it be virtual, more push in from we sel chairs
 You know all project kindness, all of those things we'll still have all of those things this year
 all of those things just may look a little bit different in terms of the mental health staff, ms graham and the office of student services
 Now under the direction of mram better with ms graham, we will be deploying guidance counselor
 All of those different all of those services are still in place, but we see we doing more proactive lessons as students come in and more push in into our classrooms, so that students feel comfortable
 we know the issues that we're seeing out there again
 our sel chairs have sent out a survey to we students at the secondary level, and I agree with you at the elementary level we're going to be doing more proactive, resiliency skill type of activities with our students
 Our health teachers for the past year have been building a health workbook for the elementary schools that are rooted in all the resiliency skills that we have been studying using the university of pennsylvania
 So we're really excited about what we can deploy for we students, and you know it goes back to, we are so worried about curriculum and we are we are
 we are going to work to ensure that all big ideas as much as we possibly can until this is all over is taught, but we first charge is just making sure that those kids feel happy and safe and healthy coming in and we staff as well
 our staff as well has not only been teaching from home prior to the summer, but our staff as well also had our staff as well own issues that our staff as well may have been you know undergoing
 So that is we number one goal here
 Thank you no problem, mr keith
 Mr science

 One of the important questions that was asked this morning was about safety and about how kids are wearing kids masks on the bus kids're getting off the bus and now kids're walking into the building with kids masks on maybe a hood on, maybe a hat on and kids're not going to be as easily identifiable as kids have in the past
 One of the suggestions was to wear lanyards with maybe id cards
 I'm just wondering what else
 If there's any other suggestions, if there's, how are we gonna, I mean
 Obviously health and safety is number one concern that that is a that is a major concern of not being able to recognize kids and especially, ninth graders, who are now new to the building
 So we don't know any of kids to begin with, and and sixth graders are now going in there
 So there's going to be a lot of unfamiliar faces and even more unfamiliar with me
, so not too unfamiliar only because we do have we transition meetings for all fifth graders going into the sixth grade and then sixth graders going into the ninth grade, and we did those virtually over the past few months prior to the ending of school
 So all teams at the high school level, in conjunction with those middle school and then middle school to elementary school
 we met on every single student, not just some, but all so those were able to physically see a picture of the student talk about the student all of those things, so so we're hoping right that there are similar, some familiar faces coming in but, like we had talked about this morning, the use of the student badges
 we have never truly enforced the way that we need to now, but we would have to ensure that the students are maintaining that and showing that because the students will be wearing masks as the students come in
 However, we are also spacing things out, so the kids aren't coming into school in mass quantities, so should, in fact you know, prior to all the badges coming out
 You need to slip down just so
 we can kind of recognize you put back up and go back in
 I think we would feel safe and comfortable in terms of that, but we'll be working with we staff working with security and seeing what other measures that we can, you know put into place
 john
 I don't know if you wanted to add anything to that
 Just to pick you wanted to add anything to that back up
 If we're going to have the kids wear the kids id cards just a matter of how fast can we get the idea

 That's the that's the only thing, and that's why I say in the beginning
 we may just have to do the old-fashioned, put it down for a second, so I can see, but you know our staff is pretty astute and granted the ninth graders
 we may not recognize them all, but we all you know
 we know we students here so, that's obviously another concern would be now we have another concern wearing another concern id cards and of course, we all know that 10 to 15 of the kids are either going to lose the kids or forget the kids
 Do we have a mechanism to reprint the kids in the building daily so that everybody has one
 Thank you,, so just for the community, we we are able to duplicate that
, thank you
 Thank you
 Miss any other questions we moved on
 I just wanted to make sure that we at least took a poll of where we stand
 As on remote learning, did we want to take a poll and leave a poll at one full year of a commitment
 Did we want to talk about a half year
 Did we want to talk about a quarter
 I think it's important that we do it now, so that we don't wait until last
 Second and we're changing[Music]
 I understand what rob was saying before about this
 I'm just curious why it wouldn't be sufficient if we just changed the language to where we could evaluate if it were possible and had people understand that it could potentially be that long, but we could, of course, if situations allow we can, we can, we can shorten it and truncate the time period
 Can I just ask a question to mr block: I mean I just just because I can foresee I'm sorry jim just because I can foresee something are we are we even legally allowed to tell somebody they're not allowed to come back
 That's you know, that's a that's an unanswered question
 You know and it's unprecedented from a legal standpoint, and you know I understand fully the operational issues from a legal standpoint
 You're going to want to see more flexibility, because the concern is that family will say that being denied
 My right education, My right education responds back, is no you're being educated, being educated remotely, but that's not the same type of education as an in-person education
 So from a legal standpoint, I would recommend that there be some flexibility built in
 I was actually going to state that if you were going to do that, still keep the year, but have a reevaluation the ability to be able to re-evaluate, as ms heinz said, that that's going to occur on a student-by-student basis
, if there's a concern from a parent, but parents are maybe being a little bit, not almost like misled, but don't not aware of the fact that there may be a re-evaluation, but that's something you may want to clarify, and you could do it in an interval period
 You could do it
 You know after the first quarter,, that's as a re-evaluation, for example
 I mean
 One of my concerns would be is that my concerns realize what remote learning entails and my concerns're I
 This is not what I signed up for we're not going live, we're not doing this or not right, and then we get an influx of kids and now class sizes grow and we don't have the space to have everybody in
 So I just I want to make sure that we have that flexibility, I'm sorry jim [Music]
, my position is I like what bill just said
 my position was to get the true figures
 The way it went out was probably the right way to go, so people aren't saying
, I can experiment for a while and we never really get a true picture, but at the same time I think if you put it if the language was softened up to say, the possibility of a full year is real
 However, you know there's going to be, independent cases that have changed, etc, etc
 So we all know that we all know that this could all change, but to get the true figure up front
 I think they have to be aware that this could be a full year of remote learning

, that's just my opinion
 and I apologize
 I don't have the survey in front of me
 I don't, I think I said could be, but I don't recall, but we could certainly again put that out once we see the numbers and if, in fact we feel like, maybe families felt a little bit, it was too strong and families're, not really quite sure we can
 we could send a call out
 we could send out an email as quick as you know now, if we wanted to the reason why I asked that question is: is that we based that plan on every single student returning
, we did so the issue is not space
 the issue is scheduling
, that's correct right
, so I view the issue as well and and because of the six feet right, you know obviously space because of that, but the six feet parameters is what allowed we to go to this plane to accommodate every kid
 They should be right
 So if we don't have all if, if not all kids return, then we will have more space, obviously and then can bring back more kids
 So so the thing is like I said: the issue is not the space matter
 You know that plan on every single student returning was devised based upon every single student returning and that's why I suggested you know, maybe doing that plan on every single student returning once you know one or four times a year
 You know
 For that reason, I understand that it could be a nightmare scheduling
 if the restrictions aren't lifted, I guess we have 13 kids
 In a seventh grade, honest math class and we're looking at a schedule, you're going to look at the section say all right put 13 kids in mrs smith's class or put 13 kids in correct
, so you know the issue is that you have this
 You have more space, it's just more of a scheduling thing, and I would imagine that if more and more kids come back from remote learning, we could reassign teachers to classrooms
,, and- and that's the point right so in a year where we're already saying the curriculum's interrupted the day has been corrupted
 That's the only thing that we wanted to minimize in the beginning and get a true account, because you don't want to be moving teachers around and upheaving schedules, but we can of course always hand select and
 You know put students in as outliers who really do need to come back, but we didn't want to forget
 I don't know who said it before
 we just didn't want people thinking, I'm going to try it out for a week and if I don't like it I'll, go because we're just
 That would be really good
 A quarter you know, and that will give we enough time to do the planning and do the scheduling if we have, if we had to
 I just think that the one year signing something this is one year, scaring out of people based upon the phone calls that I received today
 So I guess we'll have to then decide
 Are we doing flexibility
 The flexible option, obviously is the best for everybody, but do we want to say one year or do we want to say by quarter, and I guess we'll vote on that
 So if you want to do a full year, write it with flexibility, you can vote on that full year
 Flexibility,, so just put we'll put we hands up and I'll just we'll count them all full year with flexibility or flexibility with re-evaluating every quarter
, so, but maybe we could put what would be the best way to well
 I think that what I suggested would be if you want to stay with the full year, but that you re-evaluate on a quarterly basis, because I just caution we to if we all of a sudden say flexibility, then people, you know I just we have to have a true account
 School starts in two and a half weeks, and I I don't mean to be crafts about that, but we we really do, and so I think, black, the way that you had said it
 I think you know it's a year, but we would be reevaluating it throughout the year for everybody
 I I I like what he said
 Does that mean

 I don't think that you're going to make that full commitment
 I don't think you can quite frankly
 So I think that the concern was being raised was that parents, under the impression that you know no matter what I do it's a year now, if I commit it's a full year, that's not going to be the case
 we're going to look at it on a quarterly basis
 Again, it's change
 There could be a week wake up tomorrow with an executive order which states that parents, you know, can make the choice on daily basis
 You know so you know, so I
 I think that what it's going to be is that the district will look at the district
 we're going to look at we operational needs, we're going to look at the parental needs and make you know an informed decision, but that the benchmark be on a quarterly basis
 Would the benchmark be on a quarterly basis help if we provided some sample language and then you're able to let we know if that language looks appropriate, because we can send that out
 You know as quick as
 You know sunday evening or monday morning for folks perfect
 Thank you any other questions
 All right
 we are back in the agenda letter f approval of minutes
 Can I have a motion motion by mr mike caruso second and by meredith opie
 All in favor opposed abstentions
 Motion is carried number two
 we are in the visitors section public comment that pertains to the agenda
 I'm just going to need those cards or, if you're going to call those cards, is fine too I'm going to call up the names we do have several
 I just wanted to make a reminder announcement that the visitor section, the public comment is in fact a public comment
 It's not a question and answer type of period, so I know that some of the cards that we are getting do have questions on some of the cards that we are getting
 I think possibly it's better
 You know to if, if questions are asked, we can have questions are asked written down and we can take your email and we can have a response sent to you by email
 If that's good or mr picarella, if you want, we can also include questions are asked in we forum on monday
 That's fine right
 I just think it would possibly be best to email or you know, speak with you separately regarding,
 So the first gentleman, mr caputo, I'm sorry capuano, oh, my name is capuano
 My daughter is capuanocapuano
 My daughter goes to sagem, you have an excellent school here and you have an excellent school because you have the best teachers in the country
 I believe, when you take the best teachers in the country away, you have a bunch of buildings here:,, to think that you're going to lock a child in a room with a bunch of books and if you could fast forward 10 years that, like a doctor or a lawyer, is going to walk out of a room with a bunch of books
 It's just not going to happen
, now the main reason that we're all here is the six foot: six foot: six foot: six foot- that's all we're here for why
 Don't we tell everybody that that's a farce
 If you build the partitions around the desk, the six foot is not necessary and I called osha and I called the governor's hotline
, if you build the glass petition, the best teachers in the country are worried
 Also
 I understand that if you build a glass petition against the front, the best teachers in the country could walk in the back and the best teachers in the country would be behind the glass petition
 711 protects the best teachers in the country cashiers and they all come in when it's time for the best teachers in the country shift and the best teachers in the country're back there
 Furthermore, the best teachers in the country could walk in behind the best teachers in the country petitions and take the best teachers in the country masks off
 the best teachers in the country could be up there with the blackboards and take their masks off and everything would be back to normal
 This is all we're all here, because we're refusing to build their petitions
 You could take the desk
 There's schools that have taken the desk and they divide it like this boom and boom and there's four children on the desk and it's totally legal you can be
 When you put a mask on then or any kind of petition, they said you could be nose to nose
 I was just in a restaurant that was so packed the booth, the person right behind me I turned around
 I was looking right in his face
 I called the hotline from there because- and they said as long as there's a petition, there was a petition in between the booths and the glass petition was only this tall
 I was looking in the guy's eyes and they said there's no regulations for the height of the glass petition
, so all we need is the glass petition, and all this is gone
, second of all, second solution: why don't you just have the people that want to come into school and the teachers that want to come into school come in and the ones that want to stay home and the children that want to stay home stay home instead of forcing the ones that are horrified to come in to come in and the ones that are desperate to come back in
 My daughter wants My daughter teachers and My daughter wants My daughter school and My daughter wants My daughter friends
, what
 If all the cops and firemen and what, if the truck drivers that supply the supermarket didn't come in
 Everybody who needed to came in to to help and all the cops and firemen and what, if the truck drivers that supply the supermarket didn't come in kept america going to mind odds that the schools are the only ones that let us down now, as this gentleman said these kids in five years, if us could fast forward to the ones that are starting now, all the cops and firemen and what, if the truck drivers that supply the supermarket didn't come in won't be able to read and write
 I don't know how many people go to europe, but these kids already can't read and write
 us are kids in college
 That can't add this is the death knell of america
 This is not some small thing here that you're deciding and there's no reason
 These are guidelines
 Schools all around you hop hog everything else open five days
 This is your decision to do in the generation right here
 Remember that this is the beginning of the end of america,,
 us hope that they rescind this, but if they don't rescind this, this few years here will be known as the covid dummies
 they won't make this few years here into college
 they won't do anything and there's no reason and anyway
 Lastly, I want to say, if you open the schools, why bother the first kid or the first teacher that gets covered you're going to close all of sagem
 So this is all the foss all this money, the reopening programs and everything
 It's all a big fuss,, It's it because this is being treated like the bubonic plague
 capuanocapuano, I'm sorry there's a three minute time limit
, thank you
 Studies all around the world have opened up
 There's not one case
 The ymca tracked The ymca own tracing 40, 000
 Kids, not one mr kevin
 Thank you very much for coming
 We appreciate it
 Thank you so much for listening and I wanna say
 Lastly, the governor said this is for We to talk not three minutes
 I listened to this young lady for three hours
 That was not the guidelines
 You're worried about guidelines, guidelines, the governor said the people should be able to come in and talk not listen to
 The ymca tell me what to do with my child

 Thank you very much
, miss muchitash
 can I just start sure um, my name is lauren mukhitash I've been in station for 13 years now I have elementary age children, I'm going to jump the agenda
 I'm sorry,, I'm going to jump the agenda a little bit and go to item 12
 there's been a proposal to create a divor diversity task force in sacrum, central school district
 I'm here to voice my support for the creation of that task
 Force sachem student body is comprised of 25 percent racial minority students
 Our e and l students represent a staggering 98 different languages spoken within this district of 13 000 students
 Our students represent a multitude of cultures, religions and abilities representation matters
 We multifaceted student body deserves to see Our students reflected in Our students teachers and administrators in the books Our students have access to and read and then the curriculum Our students are taught
 So I would just plead with the board
 don't render this to a toothless subcommittee with no power
 There are lots of things that I love about sagem, and I think that this is a step in the direction to improve upon what We already have a strong foundation for
 Thank you
 I'm sorry
 Next is
 Mr warren hi, my name is jason moore, I'm a parent in the community, sageman graduate
 I would like to make a plea to the board: value and respect the school community by maintaining a high standard of transparency and communication at all times, but particularly in times of crisis
 The communication from the central office and the board has been unacceptable
 The communication from the central office and the board is essential for every member of the school community students, teachers and families to be constantly updated at all times about every aspect of the reopening process
 The meeting The meeting was not advertised to the school community at large
 There were five parents outside barely and five parents left as soon as possible, communicate the following
 communicate the following immediately
 How will we ensure that we remote students are receiving an equitable education
 I can't accept that our remote students are receiving an equitable education will receive a subpar education
 You've put in your email that I received
 While I was standing up front says it will not be the same
 I need it to be equitable
 I need my child to get an equitable education
 They need to be live instruction and ongoing assessment
 We need to figure it out
 We need to put programmers in place
 We need to figure it out
 it has to be figured out
 We cannot make an exception where part of We is receiving a subpar education
 It's not acceptable, not acceptable to me should not be acceptable to you and it's not acceptable to your teaching staff
 I know that for a fact
 Secondly, a building space plan must be made available to the teacher to the parents of the school community with individual room measurements and the capacity to maintain authentic social distancing at all times, and I need to know about the source of ventilation
 I need to know what the school buildings look like
 If you're telling me 17 kids in a classroom, I need to know that there's room for 42 square feet for every 17 one of those students I need
 I need that in writing
 Before I even think about sending my child back, I need clear opportunities for all parents to participate in this process
 I shouldn't stumble upon this
 I should be knowing about this weeks in advance
 I need specific criteria for testing and tracing in all school buildings
 I need a contingency plan for what happens when the rate of transmission rises above three percent
 What do I do with my child
 How do I make accommodations
 I need to know these things before we put we kids on those buses
 It's unacceptable that you're asking me to put a remote survey in place by friday, and your first parent meeting is on monday
 That's unacceptable
 The parents need to know
 What's going on, the school community needs to know
 What's going on, the teachers need to know, everybody needs to know it's unacceptable,
 I need you to do a better job of communicating with the school community
 Most important details need to be related to about our children's education in the future
 address these issues immediately
 The students, the teachers, the families in the school community deserve at least this much
 Thank you
 Thank you very much
 Miss favaro campbell, I'm michelle for campbell
 I wanted to just address the board about the diversity task force
 As all of you know, I started that email and requested that that email be put on the agenda and that you all consider creating one
 that email's been 10 years that I, my daughter, started she's going to be a senior now so 10 years ago I actually started talking to a lot of district office, which is very changed now
 Maybe mr scavo might have been on the board of ed back then I don't remember, but most of you are not we're not then
 It's been 10 years, since my family started talking about the having more diversity and representation within sachem and I'm really excited to see It finally make an agenda
 I want to also make It really clear that It's about race, religion and abilities
 I want children in wheelchairs to see children in wheelchairs in books in children in wheelchairs classrooms
 I want children with autism to know that children with autism are just as represented as every other kid in every princess book in every superhero story, and I want to help show our curriculum expand to teach children that kids with down syndrome can be teachers, because there are stories of preschool teachers who have down syndrome and kids, who are deaf and blind can grow up to graduate harvard law, school and become disability advocates and travel the entire world, and I right now our just don't show that our don't have the staff
 our don't have diversity in the staff
 our don't have diversity even in the books that they see when they walk into a classroom
 So I just wanted to thank you all for putting it on the agenda tonight and for entertaining the idea and to understand that the idea's actually bigger than one issue, it's about every kid at sagem walking into their classroom, walking through hallways and right now, where I know reopening and dealing with covid, but this has been 10 years actually a little bit more in the making and sacrum is going to go on long before my daughter, who's going to be a senior and my son is going to be a freshman in high school my daughter, who's going to be a senior and my son is going to be a freshman in high school're going to be gone, and I don't want to leave that task force like I want this to be 10 years from now
 Every kid who's just coming into kindergarten or the upk program has a very different experience than what Every kid who's just coming into kindergarten or the upk program had, and so that's really important to me that you all knew that
 So
 Thank you
 Thank you
 Miss sanders,, everyone, oh, everyone, maria sanders,
 I am a parent
 I would like to just make a statement in respect to the reopening committee
 I I was a member of the reopening committee and I just would like to express my disappointment in the fact that the reopening committee had no part in the actual planning or process of of the plan that was presented to the community
 My understanding was that we would be part of that process, but instead we had two meetings where we were basically given the list of directives as administration and and the board had planned
 So basically, we got a sneak peek and the ability to ask a few questions, though I certainly respect the time and effort and energy that administrators put in, and I will not take anything away from that
 You fail to utilize the very volunteers that you asked for because there was a tremendous amount of talent within that grouping and we certainly could have helped you in putting together the plan that was presented to the community for myself having students in second in middle school and high school
 I recognize that the plan that was presented to the community is not going to be adequate for myself having students in second in middle school and high school and again, though, I understand right now, we we're hoping that the testing standards are loosened
 The value of a full-time education will not be, and these children cannot get a full-time education when these children're in school
 Fifty percent of the time these children're only seeing a teacher, fifty percent of the time and these children're these children're sitting home in front of a computer for the other 50 that amounts to 10 days a month when normally these children would be in school for five days a week
 So I just asked that in the future, when you come to the community- and you ask we to step up and come in and help you really utilize we, because we voice really has not been heard
 That's it
 Thank you
 Thank you

 There you go andy
 Can I have a motion motion by mr coggins
 Second by mr wadawa discussion, discussion
 I will be voting on this in the next two personnel items

 My reasons are the same as My reasons've been for the past several board meetings concerning central administrative positions
 That is, I believe, the new superintendent should be part of the process in any administrative appointments

 What I must make perfectly clear is that these candidates, as well as those from the prior meetings, are qualified and capable of the positions to which they are being offered, and I would fully support they if the new superintendent was part of the process
 So this is a process, negative vote and nothing to do with the personnel
 the new superintendent is close
 I mean we're almost there and we certainly have qualified staff who could perform these functions for a short time as interims, so that for that reason, and that reason alone, I'm voting no on the next three administrative positions
 I must stress it has nothing to do with the individuals
 I fully support the individuals and would support the individuals in the future
 Mr kieran, just because you asked for a discussion and for the public and anybody at home by losing our superintendent, our assistant superintendent and our special ed director, our would have left three positions open where our would have needed interims and just for argument's sake, mr o'keefe
 What is the going rate for an interim at that level per day
 For which position are our speaking
 Let's say it's: the superintendent rates vary, but a going rate for superintendent is probably 12 to 1300 a day, and then what about the assistant super
 An assistant superintendent, depending upon which position it could be 800 to 1000 a day and an executive director of special ed would also probably be in a similar range, a minimum of 800 a day
 So what and- and I don't necessarily disagree with your argument- but what what our did was our took a vote to have these positions filled
 our had three people doing five people's jobs and it between losing that on a normal year is almost impossible, but losing it during covet is is impossible and our put things into motion to have these positions filled by qualified people to save that money, and this is money that I mean our our already just talked about taking custodians off- that our don't even know if buildings are going to get cleaned in time
 Now our want to take more money out by filling these positions with indoors
 I think that that's a slippery slope if we go down that path
, I appreciate what you're saying my
 My position is that a superintendent of schools,, is the single most important person in the district and totally accountable to us and the district for making decisions and to have a superintendent of schools, not part of the process
 Even though a new superintendent come in and doesn't know, the personnel is certainly going to ask the qualified people who who the personnel are and do cement and be part of the process
 I I think that's even more important than the saving of a few dollars here and there, but that's I mean I, I see I'm alone in that position, but I stand by that position
 I I understand where you're coming from I just if I don't appoint somebody until september 1, that's a long period of time at thirteen hundred dollars a day, eight hundred dollars a day, and while it seems like a few dollars here and there over a three month period that we haven't had people that it starts to add up, and when we need money down the line, I would be afraid that we put the line on in a room is when we had qualified people who could take these positions immediately
 I will remind you of your fiscal prudence soon, [Laughter] alex just because we're having a discussion, so mr kiernan, the people that were appointing tonight, I I have personally known all of them
 So it's without hesitation that I think that them are the best fit for sachem
 I don't care who our superintendent is
 I've trusted mr o'keefe, as our interim superintendent, to make the recommendations, and I 100 percent agree that any superintendent coming in will not find any better candidates than the ones our're putting forth tonight
 Opposed motion is carried dennis, our're going to start with andrew larson, so andrew larson just want to welcome you to the high school north principalship, andy has been a teacher in our schools
 andy's been in personnel, andy's been in an elementary hiawatha principleship, a sagamore principalship, an ap and two of our high schools, and now andy's joining the ranks of the leader ship in north and our'd like to welcome you and wish you all the best our are on letter

 So we all there was a question from the community about when the committees would start meeting and how I think that, maybe, if people that were leading these committees, we all want to maybe set some dates
 we all could do something virtually I'd like to see the budget committee start talking about if there was a possible mid-year cut and look into any and all options that there was
 I don't know if there was anything else that you may want to look into, but that's just one that I thought of
 I don't know about the budget committee
 If mr kiernan has anything for the budget committee,, all right number, 12, we all are back on public comment
 This portion of public comment will be on any and all items that anybody wants to speak at
 That's not on the agenda, and everyone will have three minutes to discuss and, we all said before, this is not a q a and a back and forth, but we all do want everyone to be able to be heard
 That wants to be heard
, the first one is miss young [Music]
, I press this
, thank you for waiting for so long
 Thank you
 You guys have been outside the season board of education, members and community
 It's come to my attention that vp sarah waterworld wore a bill
,, we're a blm t-shirt at a board of education meeting
 This is unacceptable
 I can respect a person's right to free speech and to have their opinion
 However, blm is a political movement and blm does not belong at our border bed meetings or in our schools and indoctrinations
 The definition of a racist is paramount in the name of black lives matter
 the name of black lives indicates that black lives matter over the other races
 This is unacceptable and this racism does not belong, including blm is putting blm over our law enforcement, which many of our community are employed and of all races this once again making blm a black organization
 Furthermore, new york attorney general attorney general james or the black lives matter foundation to see solicitations of new york donations that has new york attorney general attorney general james or the black lives have not registered as a charitable organization
 new york attorney general attorney general james or the black lives do not know whether the blm t-shirt, that was worn was for the black lives foundation or movement in either case
 It has no right if any one of the board members wore my hat supporting trump, I'm sure the same thing would happen
 The apology that was put on facebook was cynical and scolding
 Call new york attorney general attorney general james or the black lives as all races and insisting blm is not is not a political issue
 Last I checked
 Everyone in america had the same rights regardless of race, sex, color and sexual orientation
 As specific cases of discrimination are happening in our community, then our must address those issues
 What offended me is the use of rap music before sporting events, glorifying women's segregation, drug use and the cursing and the songs with the word and in the word this is not acceptable
 If we are going to talk about discrimination, we are going to talk about discrimination can we are going to talk about discrimination's got to be used both ways
 So, let's start by banning that bml, not political, tell that to the murder black trump supporter bernal tramell
 Furthermore, the disgusting political use of blm as an attack on our police and blue lives is not acceptable
 Our community of all sects and races is made up of law enforcement
 blm is declaring war against all blue lives matter
 Miss young there's a three-minute time limit
 Thank you
 Thank you very much, miss o'connell, so conor
 Thank you very much for waiting
 I know that it's been a while
, I am beyond angry at what is going on with our children
, our are not doing the right thing by our children in any way, shape or form at this point in time whether our want to send our children to school or keep our children home
 Neither of those options currently are acceptable
 I sent everybody board members in email
 I got one reply challenged every one of board members to go and spend 10 minutes in one of the one of the classrooms
 On the first floor in the second floor of one of the high schools did any of you do that
 I didn't think so
 Yet you all think it's fine, obviously that we have no ventilation in the classrooms for crying out loud
 we have to have special ventilation in the malls and other businesses, but where we most vulnerable are we don't
 None of you would work in these classrooms in the current conditions, None of youyou
 So why would you think it's okay for our children to be in there even before this, but definitely now now the air in those classrooms just stands there, because there's no movement, there's,, nothing and covert will stand in the air in those classrooms until it falls down on somebody so you're putting our children in an environment that is guaranteeing that if somebody has gold, but it's going to get on all the rest of our children horrendous, it's despicable and now I'm hearing that remote learning is going to be a joke
 That's not okay
 Either
, I don't want my child in one of those rooms
 I want my child safe, but my child is taking five ap classes next year, which means my child needs a robust distance learning program
 But my understanding is our're not doing that
 Am I incorrect
 No
 So what our're doing to our children is despicable and you should all be ashamed of yourself just a second
 Mr block, just a second, I'll get your answer question right now
 I had a conversation with him
 You know, I know that you were asking the question about the being restricted in terms of the assembly, but it's pursuant to the governor's executive order, one of the number of executive orders 202
45, I looked
 I believe I looked at that one, and that was talking about social media
 This is okay, I'm just gonna back up just a little bit just so our can keep our space now
 It talks about non-essential gatherings
, and this is not essential
 That's correct as long as while we're virtual, because you still have the option of being virtual, the board decided to assemble
 so so our decided
 This was not essential
 So because you decided the governor, that's not that they don't decide

 So who decides well, there's based upon the governor's orders
 the governor said that this is an honest
 the governor said that we can conduct this meeting virtually or, you can but
 So as long as you can conduct it, virtually meeting is considered to be non-essential because you have the ability to be able to connect the virtual reality
, thanks thank you for that
 It's, black, so 202
45 It was extended by 202
53 and it's in effect, until august 20th,, next fury good evening, I'm a proud sacrum educator and a parent of three daughters who attend sageman schools
 I'm here tonight to voice my concerns regarding the secondary reentry plan
 I have a daughter in eighth grade and I also have a senior
 I have grave concerns regarding the lack of an equitable education for our secondary students
 These children will suffer the ramifications of this decision in which These children will only receive 50 of the curriculum for years to come
 In some instances, this decision in which they will only receive 50 of the curriculum for years to come may change the course of These children adult lives
 I don't want that to happen to my children and I don't want it to happen to anyone else's
 I implore you to reconsider the secondary reentry plan and attempt to find a way to make the secondary re-entry plan more equitable, so that our chm students can receive 100 of the curriculum that our chm students are entitled to just like our elementary students
 Thank you
 That's all 23 board discussions
 The first one we put on today was an adoption of the 20 2021 calendar
 There was a talk of a change
 Mr o'keefe
 It's just you know something I want to bring to the board's attention because obviously administration has been meeting with district administrators as well as our teachers looking at the opening of school and just trying to be sure that we can be as prepared as possible for whatever that is
 Other districts have taken a look at this and also chosen that option each year a district is allowed up to four superintendents conference days
 Our current calendar has three
 The first two are in september the september second, and third days are superintendents conference days and the third one would be
 On election day november
 Third, Our've been discussing the possibility of having the board consider the ninth, which is wednesday, I'm sorry, eighth, which would be the the first day of school for students to be a third superintendent's conference day in september
 That would give staff teachers administrators everything all the time that staff teachers administrators need to be sure if there are those last minute, tweaks changes to classroom setups changes to schedules assignments
 Whatever the case is, you know, I had a lengthy conversation with mr barbara last night
 You know his guidance
 Counselors are ready to dive in to do whatever work needs to be done to make our secondary experience as good as possible, but our need the data first
 So once our have that data we can dive in on this, our don't have much time and time is not on our side
 So for your consideration, our'd like to talk about adding the eighth as a superintendent's conference day
 Would our have to remove another day off the calendar for that our would just convert that date to a super
 I wouldn't alter the calendar right now other than that
 Obviously, since the year hasn't even begun, the year still keeps us within legal limits
 the year still leaves our the flexibility if our were to have a severe winter
 You know, maybe with the new reality of our ability to switch between distance learning
 Maybe that can even help our
 You know in bad storms and things like that, where our might be able to turn something like that on and not lose instructional time, but I think giving the staff that extra time, especially since our're down to the wire you know, could be helpful now on the counter side
 Obviously, families are already starting to make plans families're ready to send kids back on the 8th families've already made decisions families've arranged child care
 Whatever the case is so the case isn't just as simple as you deciding let's re-adopt a calendar, and maybe it's not even something you do tonight
 Maybe it's something you consider you think about, and maybe it's on the next agenda for the 26th, but I wanted to bring the 26th to your attention to give you some time to think about the 26th and talk about the 26th
 you know
 Is it a possibility where our could consider that day, for additional staff planning
 Does anybody have a question about the calendar
 I'm just thinking our're gonna make this decision in which they will only receive 50 of the curriculum for years to come
 our have to make this decision in which they will only receive 50 of the curriculum for years to come tonight, so parents do have enough time to make arrangements
 Mr bauman, can you what kind of professional development day would it look like
 What would it look like
, it would be a useful day for the teachers too
 It's not a none
 I mean miss heinz, can speak better to the professional development days
 None of them are going to be like the normal professional development days
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean professional development superintendent's day
 Would it be a day that the teachers would be able to kind of get the teachers stuff together
, we so I mean, as we've been saying, our teachers have been working hard all summer ongoing professional development
 This is really more honored space for our teachers, so our teachers can continue to clean up
 Get things ready, make sure the google classrooms all things lessons, are in place
 So not our traditional
 You know ad camp style superintendents conference days, but our recognize that it's a tremendous amount of work to get started
 Does anybody have any other questions
 Does anybody want to vote on it tonight or did you was the request made by the staff to have that extra data to get ready
 the request made by the staff to have that extra data to get ready came through a conversation
 You know, administration and staff have asked for the request made by the staff to have that extra data to get ready
 So I agree with sarah the earlier the better I would agree as well
 We can vote on the request made by the staff to have that extra data to get ready right now
 All right motion to change the calendar to the eighth being a staff development day
 Second, by miss volpe, all in favor opposed the calendar is done, get that information out to families as quickly as possible
 The next item up for discussion is future board letter writing
 This is something that I personally put on
 I I don't think that we should be putting letters out to the community if, with all of we names on it, if we don't agree with what it says, and I could be in the minority on that- but I'm I would be fine with writing a letter, putting spaces underneath and letting those who agree
 Do it now most times it's a nine, nothing and there's no issues but
 You know I personally didn't agree with the letter that got put out and if my name is going to be on my name especially admonishing another board member
 I have to agree with my name and that's just the way I personally feel about my name
 I understand that we're a body and I get that, but at the end of the day, it's our name and our have to put our head on our pillows and if our don't agree with something I want everyone to have the freedom to not only say that but be able to just to live with the decisions that are made and to be able to stand up to the community and say here
 I did this or I did not do this and have a straight face when you say this, I I just I didn't agree and it's my fault for you know ever putting my name on that piece of paper
 So I just I want to put that piece of paper from here on out
 If anyone has an issue, feel free, but if, whatever letter it is, our write the letter that got put out, our names are on the bottom and our can sign the letter that got put out if our agree with the letter that got put out
 If our don't, our take the space away and then you don't have to sign the space
 If you don't want to, but at least you can, you can make your own decision and you don't have to feel like you're beholden, because maybe your own decision's only five people who agree with your own decision and five out of the nine agree and now, all of a sudden, it's a board decision and your name goes on it, no matter what jim so, how do you determine whose name is going on suppose four people want the letter that got put out is: is that sufficient to send the letter that got put out with four names
 That's
 That's why it's up for discussion, so I did it
 So it's got to be a majority
 Take to even have the letter that got put out go out, so five members have to support the letter that got put out and then, let's suppose the letter that got put out's a 5-4, the letter that got put out does go out board of education and the five members who agree with the letter that got put out sign the letter that got put out
 That's I'm going to see that if anybody had an issue with that, I I just wanted to address it tonight so that we haven't had a chance to get all together in a room
 So so let me express you on the opposite end of the spectrum
 If four people want to put a letter out and it's a four or five board, the four people be able to put a letter out, because the way that, when you sign up for the board of education, you sign up as a group, and you vote as a group- and, listen, there are things that happened in the past
 Why
 I was on the no side of a vote where I got dragged to the mud, but I signed up for that
 You know, so my my impression is that five is a majority and and it's what moves resolutions and it's what moves you know
 You know different different incent, you know initiatives and so on and so forth
 So so I think the easy way to do that is that when you're getting attacked by a community member, because of what the letter that got put out says, your response is look the board of education
 The board majority voted on the board of education
 I don't necessarily agree with the board of education
 You know, if you have concerns, contact the rest of the board of education
 You know and that's how we leave the board of education
 Just just my just my personal opinion this I happen to disagree only because when we pass, let's just say the new principle for sage of north in the in the minutes, it will reflect that what jim voted
, it's not going to vote that
, we voted, but if you go look in the in the back to it, what jim can say I I I said and what jim could say anybody to the community and here's why I voted and what jim could put what jim head on what jim polo and what jim's fine like it will not reflect that
 I said and, and just, I think it's wrong- that you get dragged through the mud on stuff that you voted no for, and you can't even back it up, because there is no record of you ever saying
, unless you look through certain things on votes, but if it's a letter, there's no record of anybody saying, but if the letter that got put out's coming from the board of education is the letter's coming from the board of education coming from the board of education
 Is the letter's coming from the board of education coming from five board members
 I mean I, so I guess my point is: I don't think we should be writing any letter
 That's admonishing another member I mean most most letters are in agreement to the state saying we need we funding to the state saying we don't agree with certain things that most most letters're doing, but we should certainly not be or so and- and maybe, black, you can answer this
 When we get elected to the board of education, my voice means nothing more than anybody sitting out there
 my voice only means one as part of we nine
 we I have no say I can't decide anything
 I have no more decision making than my neighbor next door
 My my only input or influence comes as as a board of nine, so the letters that we had done previously, like supporting we seniors graduating in person or the denouncement of betty devos as the education or denouncing racism that was issued as a board, not as me as an individual
 So I think legally, black, if you could just give we some guidance here that, when the board of education of sagem school district issues a letter, I think it has to come from the board of education
 If laura slattery, who who lives in wisconsin, wants to send a letter to governor cuomo, then I signed my name: laura slattery, not laura slattery, ch, board of education, trustee and- and that's I feel that me on the board of education, I'm not a republican democrat independent anything
 I am representing a community of 55 000 registered voters, my personal opinions or anything I feel personally does not matter when I'm sitting here with the nine nine of we
 My only thing that I can do as a board trustee is in as a majority of the board of education
 Unless, legally you see something, that's how I feel I was elected by the voters
 I was elected by the community
 I I feel like I have to represent the community as one of nine, not as laura slattery individual and, of course I don't think, that's being suggested, but we're a governing body and every governing body around the country operates that way
 You operate as a body, you're elected to be part of a body
 You make decisions as a as a body
 There may be differences of opinion, that's part of our democracy
 That's what makes the country great you'll, be able to express those opinions
 At the end of the day, you have to make a collective decision, and then you have to abide by the decision that that body makes one possible solution
 Is that
 If you are going to issue a letter and there's concerns that dissenting members vote is not going to be known like it is
 When we take a public vote, you can take a public vote to send a letter, and then you can adopt a letter as a majority vote
 Those who dissent are on as a matter of record Those who dissent're on Those who dissent're on record, if that's the case, so so you're saying that no one member is allowed to remove Those who dissent name from a letter
 I would say that that's not typical practice that you would see, but is that's not typical practice that you would see legal for a member to remove a name
, if the, when a letter is going out, I don't think a name typically sets forth all the names
 I don't know
 I don't really like to say it
 Has it printed all your names on the left side, it says, there's a list of all the names and on the bottom, it's the president's name
 So, on the left side of a letter it has all of our names listed
 But that's your that's
 Your letterhead lists all your names
 It doesn't indicate whether or not you voted for a letter to go out or not
 It's you're represented on Your letterhead
 Your letterhead's an official board of education stationery
 That's why your name is on there
 your name's not signaling that you voted for that or not, but the recognition is, though, that when you do take a vote or when the board of education puts out material that that's so so that's a fine, that's a compromised decision
 I think that any and all letters should be discussed in public and voted in our public
 That is a concern that you have that's one way of addressing it
 I I was just going
 I was just going to say that that sounds like an excellent idea and that really just goes back to you said about my vote
 You know is on record and your eight votes are on record for these fine individuals here
 So that would be the same thing
 We discuss a letter
 You know We take a vote on a letter
, if it's a majority vote, a letter will go, but the dissenters are also in the minutes
 I like a letter and I'm 100 in agreement with that
 This way, it's a public discussion
 Anybody can look back, but then We still are issuing a letter based on a majority of the board of education, but as long as there's a record of who votes and who votes
, I'm correct
 I am 100 fine with that
 Just one statement and me and laura have gone round and round about this before, but I want to
 I want to make this point
 Look we're all elected members to the board of education as any elected official is
 If I want to write a letter- and I want to sign my letter bill, cogan board trustee sachem, I'm 100 within my rights- to do that
 It's a matter of opinion as to whether or not I should do that if I want to get together with four other board members and each one of We want to sign it as board trustees
 Once again, We are within We rights to do that
 All right
 It may be perceived as a bad idea by the board of education, but there's nothing illegal about the board of education
, inside it's not a vote
 I don't think We're going to take here
 I just I just wanted to make sure that We discussed it and there was at least a public so that all future letter writing is done in public and just also just to add to all future letter writing
 It's been customary that at the bottom of a letter, the signature block states, the president's name on behalf of just signed a letter sincerely the board of education and not place the president's name on the bottom of a letter
,, the last item up for discussion is the diversity task force
 So, as you guys know, I gave you guys all an outline about what just got a little bit closer
, I gave you all the an outline, probably in the end of july, and I don't know if you all got a chance to look all the an outline over
 I shared all the an outline with the board of education again the other day
 Sarah
 So I would just like to make a motion to put all the an outline on to vote tonight on establishing the diversity task force
 I mean my my only issue is, and I don't have a problem with the diversity task force, but the way community committees are usually done is that we could vote to establish one give direction to administration to come back as to what the charge is going to be talk about the charge and then approve the charge
 I I I would say that that's that's, probably the route we should go and in the years that have been on the board of education, we establish construction capital projects, committees and you know some are established for one specific job and then they they they disappear, and that was for one of the
 You know construction projects that we did after that we didn't do any for a while
 So we didn't need that organization, but I would say that we we either vote on that organization tonight
, we want to pursue something like this
 we understand what the end game is, what we're trying to achieve and then normally what happened is administration would put together a packet of a pamphlet, that's made available to the community
 administration could download the community in a pdf format
 People would sign up for the community submit in the same way People would for a budget advisory committee
 You know or so or you know any other thing, so I would just say that we we follow a pdf format
 You know and- and you know, we're not adopting exactly what the world but we're establishing a diversity, task force and and charging administration to come back to we with what the charge is going to be
 I would have no problem with that
 Any questions everyone all in favor of I'm sorry, yep
 I read the whole thing like lots of times
 I think it's great, you know we need it here in saturn, all in favor, all right any opposed
 Mr picariello, this still one visitor that we had called wasn't here at the time
 miss williamson
 Thank you, miss williamson, I'm sorry
 I know that it's late, I apologize
 I was doing yard work and I was listening
 Thank you and I had to come so I apologize
 This is my first time doing anything like this, so I really don't have anything written out or able to look up anything outside
 So I'll tell you about myself
 I have four children, three at hiawatha, two of them with severe nut allergies and one of them with viral induced asthma
 I didn't, I don't really know
, let me just go with this
 My kids are fine, My kids will be homeschooled and My kids will be homeschooled

 What about all the other children that aren't as lucky as My kids
 How come
 Nobody is talking about My kids
 How come what nobody's talking about the children getting hit at home
 How come nobody's talking about the children that aren't eating at home
 How come nobody's talking about the children that aren't learning or being sexually abused at home
 Nobody cares about My kids
 I hear a lot of things, how we're emptying the rooms and there's going to be nothing in there
 No one's allowed to touch each other, no one's allowed near each other
 we're not we're teaching we to be scared
 I was scared for a long time
 I've been hurt
 I've been scared of allergies and a nut killing
 My child fear cannot run we
 we need to stand up for who we are and what we believe in and I believe all we children deserve a fair chance at life and we are not giving life to all our children
 I think I think that's life
 Thank you very much
 I know that you waited a while
 Thank you
